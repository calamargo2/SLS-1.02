# Hosts file: names of the local hosts (see explanation below).
#
# Local Hosts Format:
#  IP_NUMBER		HOSTNAME	ALIASES
#
# Here is the name of your host, first, followed by any aliases
192.0.2.128		softland
#
# Your network number (usually same as above, with last number zero)
192.0.2.0		network
#
# Uncomment and define IP number of router if not on isolated network.
#192.0.2.1			router
#
# Local host ip num: no need to change this.

# This file is an attempt to simplify network configuration to just
# this file, plus the externally set host and domain name (see below).
# Entries up to the first dashed line are used at bootup by
# /etc/inet/rc.net, so be careful changing them.  Note that the
# hostcvt.build command only works if all hosts are on your network.
#
# Instructions:
# - Set the IP number for your host, network, and router(opt).
# - Add any other local hosts you need, then exit the editor.
# - Set your host name (/etc/host and first entry this file).
# - Set your domain name using (/etc/domain and this file).
# - Rebuild the named files (by running /etc/hostscvt.build).
# - Or skip nameserver and set /etc/host.conf to "order hosts". 
# - reboot
