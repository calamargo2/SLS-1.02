Herein lies the TCP/IP and NFS stuff.  The system
is setup with local name "softland".   The IP address is
set to 192.0.2.128.  If you are on the network, you must change
this, because it is a special reserved address, and the SLS
rc.net will not configure your ethernet interface with this address.

NFS client and server work.  You can test that it works with 
"mount -t nfs softland:/home/user1 /mnt" to mount loopback.
The list of contributors is long and disappears somewhere off into 
the mists.  I won't even try to mention any names, there are so many.

To generate new nameserver files from your /etc/hosts file, just
edit /etc/hosts and use the hostcvt.build script, which just calls hostcvt,
after you set your host name with "echo myhost > /etc/host", and your
domain with "echo my.domain > /etc/domain".  Note that hostcvt.build
works only when all hosts in /etc/hosts are on your network (same
first 3 address parts as yours).  Do "man hostcvt" for info.

Telnet and ftp are working, and you should note that anonymous ftp can be
enabled in /etc/ftpuser.   See the manpages.  Shadow password support is 
standard in SLS, and ftpd has been hacked to support it, and to support
long (16 char) passwords.  The annoying error messages you see when logging
on, can be elminated/controlled using "syslogd".
