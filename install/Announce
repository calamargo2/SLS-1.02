SLS 1.02 is now available on tsx-11.mit.edu.  It contains
99p9 source and image, and replacement boot disks a1.3 and a1.5.
The new boot disks just fix a few of the custom install features.
The network daemons are now not started until/if a NFS install
is done.  This should save some memory.  Also, doinstall now
prompts you to allow changing your IP address.  A small error
message on the tape install was also eliminated.  Plus a number of
other small items have been cleaned up.  If anyone has any more
suggestions for improvements, let me know.  However, I will be
away for the next 10 days, starting Wed.
