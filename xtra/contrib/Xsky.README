Aaron,

Tuesday with whatever of the gang you can round up would be great!  I'll
be there (just as soon as somebody tells me where Z's Pizza is :-).

BTW, vesta.sunquest.com's anonymous FTP area now contains xsky.dir with
a file called xsky.tar.Z (actually, it's got the MultiNet hack name of
xsky.tar$5n$z, but you know what I mean ...).  It's 1400 blocks long.
I appreciate your putting this up for me.  When it becomes available,
I'll post an announcement in sci.astro.

If you wanna play with this yourself on some nearby friendly Unix box,
explode the distribution and do the following:


If you're familiar with imake, there's an Imakefile that should work.
Otherwise, just edit Makefile.std to correct INCLUDES to be the path
to the X11 include files for your machine.  Then do:


source xskyenv
makebin
make -f Makefile.std   (or just "make" if you used the Imakefile)


This will create an executable called xsky.  There's no "make install",
which is probably a defect, but I just can't figure out where everybody
would like to place the data files and such, so I punted on it.  xsky.man
is the man page.

Please let me know if you have any trouble; I'll be happy to help.  I'd
also appreciate hearing what machine you run this on - I know it runs on
DECstations, Sun, HP, and SGI Indigo.  I do have one report of a seg-fault
on a Sun, which I cannot reproduce here.

Thanks for putting this up for me.  In my announcement, I'm going to ask
other FTP sites to grab it from you and make it available.  This should
keep everyone from blasting your machine (he says, egotistically believing
that *thousands* of folks will grab this ;-).

Terry
