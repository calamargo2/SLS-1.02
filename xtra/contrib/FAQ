----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:   4)* What X-related public mailing lists are available?

	The xpert mailing list is the general, public mailing list on X
maintained by the X Consortium. The mailings are gatewayed, so xpert is almost 
identical to the comp.windows.x Usenet newsgroup. 

	***	If you get comp.windows.x, you don't need to 	***
	***	be added to the xpert mailing list. 		***

	Otherwise, you can join the list to receive X information 
electronically. It is best to find a local distribution; perhaps someone within
your company is already receiving the mailing. As a last resort, send mail to 
xpert-request@expo.lcs.mit.edu with a valid return electronic address. 

	The xannounce mailing list carries major X announcements, such as new
releases (including public patches from MIT), public reviews, adoption of 
standards by the MIT X Consortium, and conference announcements.  It does NOT 
carry advertisements, source code, patches, or questions.  If you already 
receive the Usenet news group comp.windows.x.announce or the xpert mailing list,
you don't need to be added to the xannounce mailing list.  Otherwise, to 
subscribe, send a request to xannounce-request@expo.lcs.mit.edu. Note: Only 
redistribution addresses will be accepted for this list -- i.e. no personal 
addresses. If you wish to receive xannounce yourself, please contact your mail 
administrator to set up a local redistribution list and to put you on it.  

	In addition, the X Consortium sponsors these public lists:
		bug-clx         CLX bug reports and discussions
		x-ada           X and ada
		x11-3d          people interested in X and 3d graphics
		ximage          people interested in image processing and X
		xvideo          discussion of video extensions for X
	To subscribe to one of these lists, assuming no-one in your 
organization already receives it, send mail to <list>-request@expo.lcs.mit.edu
with the Subject line including the name of the LIST in caps and the request
"addition request".  In the body of the message be sure to give an address for 
your local distribution which is accessible from MIT (eddie.mit.edu).

	A mailing list for topics related to OPEN LOOK is sponsored by Greg
Pasquariello of Unify corporation; send to openlook-request@unify.com (or
openlook-request%unify.uucp@uunet.uu.net) for information. 
	A mailing list for bugs in the publicly-available version of XView
source, in particular, is sponsored by Sun; send for information to 
xviewbug-trackers-request@sun.com. 
	A mailing list for topics related to Motif is sponsored by Kee Hinckley
of Alfalfa Software, Inc.; send to motif-request@alfalfa.com for information. 
(This group is gatewayed to comp.windows.x.motif.)
	A mailing list for topics related to the XPM pixmap-format is sponsored
by Arnaud Le Hors of Group Bull; send to xpm-talk-request@mirsa.inria.fr for
information. [1/91]
	A mailing list discussing InterViews can be subscribed to by sending to 
interviews-request@interviews.stanford.edu.
	A mailing list (amiga-x11@nic.funet.fi) for topics related to the port 
of X11 to the Amiga can be subscribed by sending to mailserver@nic.funet.fi a 
message containing
		Subject: Adding myself to AMIGA-X11
		SUBS AMIGA-X11 Your Real Name

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:   5)+ What related FAQs are available?

	Liam R. E. Quin (lee@sq.sq.com) posts an FAQ list on Open Look to 
comp.windows.x.  
	Jan Newmarch (jan@pandonia.canberra.edu.au) posts an FAQ list on Motif 
to comp.windows.x.motif.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:   6)* How do I ask a net-question so as to maximize helpful responses?

	When asking for help on the net or X mailing lists, be sure to include 
all information about your setup and what you are doing.  The more specific you
are, the more likely someone will spot an error in what you are doing.  Without
all the details, people who want to help you often have to guess -- if they are
able to respond at all.

	Always mention what version of X you are using and where you got it 
from. If your server came from a different source as the rest of your X system,
give details of that, too.  Give the machine type, operating system, and O/S 
version for both the client and server machine.  It may also be appropriate to 
mention the window manager, compiler, and display hardware type you are using.

	Then tell exactly what you are doing, exactly what happens, and what
you expected/wanted to happen.  If it is a command that fails, include the 
exact transcript of your session in the message.  If a program you wrote 
doesn't work the way you expect, include as little of the source necessary 
(just a small test case, please!) for readers to reproduce the problem.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:   7)* What publications discussing X are available?

	The trade magazines (Unix World, Unix Review, Computer Language, etc.)
are publishing more articles on X. In addition to XNextEvent, the XUG 
newsletter:

	- O'Reilly and Associates publishes "The X Resource: A Practical Journal
of the X Window System" (632 Petaluma Ave., Sebastapol, CA 95472).  Information:
Adrian Nye, adrian@ora.com.

	- The X Journal is started bi-monthly publication September 1991 on a 
variety of X topics. Editorial information: Jerry Smith, Editor, 615-886-3429, 
jsmith%spectro.uucp@uunet.uu.net. Subscription information:

mcvax!unido!tub!olaf).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:   9)* What are these common abbreviations?

	Xt: The X Toolkit Intrinsics is a library layered on Xlib which 
provides the functionality from which the widget sets are built. An "Xt-based" 
program is an application which uses one of those widget sets and which uses 
Intrinsics mechanisms to manipulate the widgets.
	Xmu: The Xmu library is a collection of Miscellaneous Utility functions
useful in building various applications and widgets.
	Xaw: The Athena Widget Set is the MIT-implemented sample widget set
distributed with X11 source since X11R2.
	Xm: The OSF/Motif widget set from the Open Software Foundation; binary
kits are available from many hardware vendors
	Xhp (Xw): The Hewlett-Packard Widget Set was originally based on R2++, 
but several sets of patches exist which bring it up to R3, as it is distributed
on the X11R4 tapes. Supplemental patches are available to use it with R4/R5.
	CLX: The Common Lisp X Interface is a Common Lisp equivalent to Xlib.
	XDMCP: The X Display Manager Protocol provides a uniform mechanism for 
a display such as an X terminal to request login service from a remote host.
	XLFD: The X Logical Font Description Conventions describes a standard
logical font description and conventions to be used by clients so that they
can query and access those resources.
	RTFM: Common expert-speak meaning "please locate and consult the 
relevant documentation -- Read the Forgotten Manual".
	UTSL: A common expression meaning "take advantage of the fact that you 
aren't limited by a binary license -- Use The Source, Luke".

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  10)* What is the ICCCM? (How do I write X-friendly applications?)

	The Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual is one of the 
official X Consortium standards documents that define the X environment. It 
describes the conventions that clients must observe to coexist peacefully with 
other clients sharing the same server.  If you are writing X clients, you need 
to read and understand the ICCCM,  in particular the sections discussing the 
selection mechanism and the interaction between your client and the window 
manager.  Get it either:
	- as part of the R4 distribution from MIT.
	- in the 2nd edition of the Scheifler/Gettys "X Window System" book.
	- as an appendix in the new version of O'Reilly's Volume 0, "X Protocol
Reference Manual." A version in old copies of their Volume 1 is obsolete.
	The version in the DP book is much more readable, thanks to the efforts
of Digital's editors to improve the English and the presentation.

[from David Rosenthal, 10/90]

	- the ICCCM was updated for R5; updates are published in O'Reilly's
"Programmer's Supplement for Release 5". The complete document is on the R5
tapes.

	Alternate definition: the ICCCM is generally the M in "RTFM" and is
the most-important of the least-read X documents.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  11)  What is the X Consortium, and how do I join?

	The MIT X Consortium was formed in January of 1988 to further the
development of the X Window System and has as its major goal the promotion of 
cooperation within the computer industry in the creation of standard software 
interfaces at all layers in the X Window System environment.
	MIT's role is to provide the vendor-neutral architectural and 
administrative leadership required to make this work. Membership in the 
Consortium open to any organization.  There are two categories of membership, 
Member (for large organizations) and Affiliate (for smaller organizations).
	Most of the Consortium's activities take place via electronic mail, 
with meetings when required.  As designs and specifications take shape,
interest groups are formed from experts in the participating organizations.  
Typically a small multi-organization architecture team leads the design, with 
others acting as close observers and reviewers.  Once a complete specification
is produced, it may be submitted for formal technical review by the Consortium
as a proposed standard.  The standards process typically includes public 
review (outside the Consortium) and a demonstration of proof of concept.
	Your involvement in the public review process or as a Member or 
Affiliate of the Consortium is welcomed.
	Write to: Bob Scheifler, MIT X Consortium, Laboratory for Computer 
Science, 545 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA 02139.

Subject:  12)  Just what are OPEN LOOK and Motif?

	OPEN LOOK and Motif are two graphical user interfaces (GUIs). OPEN LOOK
was developed by Sun with help from AT&T and many industry reviewers; Motif was 
developed by the Open Software Foundation (OSF) with input from many OSF 
members. 

	OPEN LOOK is primarily a user-interface specification and style-guide; 
there are several toolkits which can be used to produce OPEN LOOK applications.
Motif includes an API specification; the only sanctioned Motif toolkit is the 
one from OSF. However, there are other toolkits which can be used to produce 
programs which look and behave like OSF/Motif; one of these, Solbourne's OI, is
a "virtual toolkit" which provides a common subset of OPEN LOOK and Motif, at 
the user's choice.

	OPEN LOOK GUI is also the name of a product from AT&T, comprising 
their OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit and a variety of applications.

[Thanks to Ian Darwin, ian@sq.com, 5/91]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  13)  Just what is OpenWindows?

	Open Windows (2.0) is a Sun product that encompasses: a window system 
that combines a NeWS and X11R4-compliant server (X/NeWS); a user-interface 
specification (OPEN LOOK) and a series of toolkits that implement it (including
the SunView-like XView and the Xt-based OLIT); Xlib and Xt implementations; and
a number of utilities (olwm window manager, filemgr, shelltool, etc.).

[thanks to Frank Greco (fgreco@govt.shearson.COM), 8/90] 

	Sun has announced [11/90] the limited availability in source form of 
major portions of the OpenWindows release.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  14)  Just what is DECWindows?

	DECWindows is a DEC product that encompasses: an X11 server; the XUI 
toolkit, including the Dwt widget set and UIL; Xlib and Xt implementations; a 
session manager; and a number of utilities (dxwm window manager, dxcalendar, 
dxpsview, etc.).

(At some point Motif flavors of the toolkit and applications will be shipped.)
[8/90] 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  15)  What is PEX?

	PEX is the "PHiGS Extension to X".
	PHiGS stands for "Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics 
System" and is essentially a library of functions that simplifies the creation 
and manipulation of 3D graphics. Many platforms are capable of performing in 
hardware the computations involved in rendering 3D objects; the extension 
allows the client (PHiGS in this case) to take advantage of the specialized 
hardware for 3D graphics.
	Sun Microsystems is currently contracted to develop a freely 
redistributable (copyright similar to the current X copyright) sample
implementation.  Source and documentation are available in the R5 release.
Several vendors are currently selling independently-developed PEX servers for 
their workstations and X terminals.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  16)  TOPIC: USING X IN DAY-TO-DAY LIFE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  17)* What are all these different window managers?

	The window manager in X is just another client -- it is not part of the
X window system, although it enjoys special privileges -- and so there is
no single window manager; instead, there are many which support different ways 
for the user to interact with windows and different styles of window layout,
decoration, and keyboard and colormap focus. In approximate chronological order
(generally, the more recent ones are more conformant with the ICCCM):

	wm: this simple title-bar window manager was quickly phased out
	uwm: the Universal Window Manager is still popular for its speed, 
although it is outdated. Moved to contrib/ on the R4 tape.
	twm (old): Tom's Window Manager was among the first non-MIT window 
managers and offered the user a great deal of customization options in a
re-parenting window manager. 
	awm: the Ardent Window Manager remains a hotbed for hackers and offers
some features (dynamic menus) not found on more current window managers
	cwm: cwm is part of the Andrew system. Notable for being the only 
window manager whose name is also an English word.
	rtl: Siemen's window manager tiles windows so that they don't overlap
and resizes the window with the focus to its preferred size
	dxwm: Digital's dxwm is part of the DECwindows offering
	hpwm: HP's window manager offers a 3D look; it is a precursor of mwm
	mwm: the Motif window manager is part of the OSF/Motif toolkit
	tekwm: Tektronix's window manager offering 
	olwm (Sun): olwm implements the OPEN LOOK GUI and some of the Style
Guide functionality
	olwm (AT&T): ditto
	gwm: Bull's Generic Window Manager emulates others with a built-in
Lisp interpreter. Version 1.7h (10/91) is on the R5 contrib tape; 1.7i is on
avahi.inria.fr and export.lcs.mit.edu.
	m_swm: the Sigma window manager is on the R4 tape
	pswm: Sun's PostScript-based pswm is part of the OpenWindows release
	swm: Solbourne's swm is based on its OI toolkit and offers multiple
GUI support and also a panned virtual window; configuration information comes
from the resources file
	twm (new): MIT's new Tab Window Manager from the R4 tape is a reworked
twm and is the basis for several derivatives, including the one on the R5 tape
	vtwm: vtwm offers some of the virtual-desktop features of swm, with a
single-root window implementation; it is based on the R4 twm and is available
on archive servers
	tvtwm: Tom's Virtual Tab Window Manager is also based on the R4 twm
and provides a virtual desktop modeled on the virtual-root window of swm. It is
available on archive servers
	olvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to Sun's olwm. It is 
available on archive servers; version 3.0 [1/92] is on export.
	NCDwm: the window manager local to NCD terminals offers an mwm look 
	XDSwm: the window manager local to Visual Technology's terminals 
	mvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to OSF's mwm. A beta version
is floating around but requires a source license to OSF/Motif.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  18)* Why does my X session exit when I kill my window manager?

	It needn't.  What is probably happening is that you are running your 
window manager as the last job in your .xsession or .xinitrc file; your X 
session runs only as long as the last job is running, and so killing your 
window manager is equivalent to logging out. Instead, run the window manager in
the background, and as the last job instead invoke something safe like:
		exec xterm -name Login -rv -iconic
Your X session will continue until you explicitly logout of this window, 
whether or not you kill or restart your window manager.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  19)  Is there a way for a WM to produce my .xinitrc, like toolplaces?

	Although no known window manager directly supports such a feature
(olvwm may have something close), there is a contributed application which does
much of what you are looking for, although it is not as complete as the SunView
program toolplaces. Look for the application "xplaces" on an archive-server 
near you. There are several versions of this program floating around; look for 
a recent vintage.
[10/90]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  20)  How do I use another window manager with DEC's session manager?

	DEC's session manager will start dxwm up by default. To override this, 
add to your .Xdefaults file something like this line, naming the full pathname:
	sm.windowManagerName:   /usr/bin/X11/your_favorite_wm

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  21)  How do I change the keyboard auto-repeat rate?

	You can turn auto-repeat on or off by using "xset r on|off". The X
protocol, however, doesn't provide for varying the auto-repeat rate, which is
a capability not supported by all systems.
	Some servers running on systems that support this (the Xsun server from
MIT, for example), however, may provide command-line flags to set the rate at 
start-up time. If you have control over server start-up, you can invoke the
server with the chosen settings. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  22)  How do I remap the keys on my keyboard to produce a string?

	There is no method of arranging for a particular string to be
produced when you press a particular key. The xmodmap client, which is useful 
for moving your CTRL and ESC keys to useful places, just rearranges keys and 
does not do "macro expansion."
	Some (few) clients, including xterm and several X-based editors, 
accept a translation resource such as:
	xterm*VT100.Translations: #override \
		<Key>F1: string("setenv DISPLAY unix:0")
which permits the shorthand F1 to be pressed to reset the display locally
within an xterm; it takes effect for new xterm clients.
	Window managers, which could provide this facility, do not yet; nor
has a special "remapper" client been made available.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  23)* How do I make a screendump of the X display?

	The xwd client in the X11 distributions can be used to select a window 
or the background. It produces an XWD-format file of the image of that window. 
The file can be post-processed into something useful or printed with the xpr 
client and your local printing mechanism. You can use this command:
		csh% sleep 10; xwd -root > output.xwd &
and then spend 10 seconds or so setting up your screen; the entire current
display will be saved into the file output.xwd. Note that xwd also has an 
undocumented (as of R4) -id flag for specifying the window id on the 
command-line.

	Two publicly-available programs which allow interactive definition of 
arbitrary portions of the display and built-in delays are asnap and xgrabsc.
There are several versions of xgrabsc; version 1.5, available on export [12/91]
is the most recent.
	xsnap includes some asnap features and supersedes it; it also renders 
XPM output [version unknown]. It is available on export, as well. [11/90]

	Also: some vendors' implementations of X (e.g. DECWindows and 
OpenWindows 2.0) include session managers or other desktop programs which 
include "print portion of screen" or "take a snapshot" options.

	Also: some platforms have tools which can be used to grab the 
frame-buffer directly. The Sun systems, for example, have a 'screendump' 
program which produces a Sun raster file. 

	Some vendors' implementations of lpr (e.g. Sony) include direct 
support for printing xwd files, but you'll typically need some other package 
to massage the output into a useful format which you can get to the printer.

	To post-process the xwd output of some of these tools, you can use xpr,
which is part of the X11 distribution. Also on several archives are xwd2ps
and XtoPS, which produce Encapsulated PostScript with trimmings suitable for 
use in presentations (see export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/xwd2ps.tar.Z and
contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z). Also useful is the PBMPLUS package on many archive
servers.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  24)  How do I make a color PostScript screendump of the X display?

	If you need color PostScript in particular, you can 
	- grab the screen-image using xgrabsc to begin with, which can produce
color PostScript.  
	- grab the screen-image using xwd and post-process xwd into color PS.
You can do this using xwd2ps or the XtoPS program from the ImageMagick 
distribution. The PBMPLUS package is also good for this.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  25)  How can I print the current selection?

	You could paste it into an xterm after executing the lpr command. 
However, a program by Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) specifically for 
manipulating the selection will help; e.g. 
	xselection PRIMARY | lpr
finds the primary selection and prints it. This command can be placed in a 
window-manager menu or in shell-scripts. xselection also permits the setting of
the selection and other properties. A version is on export.
	Also available is ria.ccs.uwo.ca:pub/xget_selection.tar.Z, which can be
adapted to do this.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  26)  How to I have xdm put a picture behind the log-in window?

The answer lies in changing xdm's xrdb resource in the xdm-config file to run a
program to change the background before loading the resources; for example, 
your /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config file may add the line 
	DisplayManager.0.authorize: false 
to permit unrestricted access to the display before log-in (beware!) and also 
	DisplayManager*xrdb:	/usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.xrdb
where that file does something (for all connections) along the lines of:
	#!/bin/sh
	# comes in with arguments: -display :0 -load /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xresources
	/usr/bin/X11/xsetroot -display $2 -bitmap /usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.bitmap
	/usr/bin/X11/xrdb $*
Substitute xloadimage or xv for xsetroot, to taste. 

[Thanks to Jay Bourland (jayb@cauchy.stanford.edu), 9/91]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  27)  Why are my xterm menus so small?

	You are probably setting the geometry small accidentally. If you give 
a resource specification like this:
		xterm*geometry: 80x24
then you are asking for all widgets under xterm to have their geometry set to
80x24. For the main window, this is OK, as it uses characters for its size. 
But its popup menus don't; they are in pixels and show up small. To set only
the terminal widget to have the specified geometry, name it explicitly:
		xterm*VT100.geometry: 80x24

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  28)  Where can I find a dictionary server for xwebster?

	Webster's still owns the copyright to the on-line copies of Webster's
Dictionary which are found at various (university) sites. After it became aware
that these sites were then acting as servers for other sites running xwebster 
and gnuemacs-webster, it asked that server sites close off external access.
	[The NeXT machine apparently is also licensed to have the dictionary. A
Webster daemon for NeXT machines is available from iuvax.cs.indiana.edu 
(129.79.254.192) in "pub/webster/NeXT-2.0".]
	Unless you want to get a legal on-line copy yourself or can find a site
which can grant you access, you are probably out of luck. 

	However, if you are a legitimate site, you'll want to pick up the
latest xwebster, as-is on export:contrib/xwebster.tar.Z [10/91]; the file 
xwebster.README includes discussions of the availability, illegality, and 
non-availability of dictionary servers.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  29)* How do I convert/view Mac/TIFF/GIF/Sun/PICT/img/FAX images in X?

	The likeliest program is an incarnation of Jef Poskanzer's useful++ 
Portable Bitmap Toolkit, which includes a number of programs for converting 
among various image formats. It includes support for many types of bitmaps, 
gray-scale images, and full-color images. PBMPLUS has been updated recently;
the most recent version [12/91] is on export in contrib/pbmplus10dec91.tar.Z.
	Another tool is San Diego Supercomputing Center's IMtools ('imconv' in 
particular), which packages the functionality of PBM into a single binary.
It's available anonymous ftp from sdsc.edu (132.249.20.22).

	Useful for viewing some image-formats is Jim Frost's xloadimage, a
version of which is in the R4 directory contrib/clients/xloadimage -- there
are later versions available; version 3.0.1 shipped 5/91 and is on export
/contrib/xloadimage.3.01.tar.Z. A major new release of xloadimage is planned;
in the mean-time, Graeme Gill's updates may hold you: see xli.README and
xli.tar.Z.uu on export.lcs.mit.edu.

	An alternate image-viewer is xv (X Image Viewer), written by 
bradley@cis.upenn.edu (John Bradley). XV displays many image formats and 
permits editing of GIF files, among others. The program was updated 1/92; see 
the file contrib/xv-2.00.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu. 

	The Fuzzy Pixmap Manipulation, by Michael Mauldin <mlm@nl.cs.cmu.edu>.
Conversion and manipulation package, similar to PBMPLUS.  Version 1.0 available
via FTP as nl.cs.cmu.edu:/usr/mlm/ftp/fbm.tar.Z, uunet.uu.net:pub/fbm.tar.Z, 
and ucsd.edu:graphics/fbm.tar.Z.

	The Img Software Set, by Paul Raveling <raveling@venera.isi.edu>, reads
and writes its own image format, displays on an X11 screen, and does some image
manipulations.  Version 1.3 is available via FTP on expo.lcs.mit.edu as
contrib/img_1.3.tar.Z, along with large collection of color images.

	Xim, by Philip R. Thompson, reads and writes its own image format,
displays on an X11 screen, and does some image manipulations.  Available in 
your nearest X11R4 source tree as contrib/clients/xim.  A more recent version 
is available via ftp from video.mit.edu.  It uses x11r4 and the OSF/Motif 
toolkit to provide basic interactive image manipulation and reads/writes GIF, 
xwd, xbm, tiff, rle, xim, and other formats.

	ImageMagick by cristy@dupont.com can be retrieved as the file 
contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z (no patch level) from export.lcs.mit.edu.  It is a 
collection of utilities to transform and display images on any X server. The
tool uses the MIFF format; filters to and from MIFF from other popular formats 
(PPM, TIFF, GIF, SUN Raster, etc) are included.

	xtiff is a tool for viewing a TIFF file in an X window.  It was written
to handle as many different kinds of TIFF files as possible while remaining
simple, portable and efficient.  xtiff illustrates some common problems
with building pixmaps and using different visual classes.  It is distributed
as part of Sam Leffler's libtiff package and it is also available on
export.lcs.mit.edu, uunet.uu.net and comp.sources.x. [dbs@decwrl.dec.com,10/90]
xtiff 2.0 was announced in 4/91; it includes Xlib and Xt versions.

	A version of Lee Iverson's (leei@McRCIM.McGill.EDU) image-viewing tool
is available as contrib/vimage-0.9.1.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.  The package 
also includes an ImageViewPort widget and a FileDialog widget. [12/91]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  30)*  How can I change the titlebar of my xterm window?

	The solution involves sending an escape sequence to xterm which will
cause it to update the property which the window manager relies upon for the
string which appears in the window titlebar.
	A solution is as easy as typing this in an xterm running a shell:
		echo "ESC]2;TEXT^G"
where ESC is the escape key, TEXT is the string you wish to have displayed,
and ^G is a Control-G (the BEL character).

	Here is a more complicated csh alias which changes the titlebar to
the current working directory when you change directories:
		alias newcd 'cd \!*; echo -n ESC]2\;$cwd^G'

	The digit '2' in these strings indicates to xterm that it should 
change only the title of the window; to change both the title and the name 
used in the icon, use the digit '0' instead, and use '1' to change only the 
icon name.

	Note: another way to do this, which prevents an incorrect display of
the local directory if a modified `cd` is used in a subshell, is to wrap the
escape sequences into the PS1 prompt itself.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  31)  Where can I find the xterm control sequences?

The best source of such information is in your R5 sources in the file 
ctlseqs.ms; a PostScript version is in mit/hardcopy/clients/ctlseqs.PS.Z.

Other good sources of information include the R4 version of that document
and also the file in the R4 sources called mit/clients/xterm/ctlseq2.txt, a 
compilation put together by Skip Montanaro (GE CR&D) listing the VT100 
sequences. It dates from R3 but is fairly accurate.  A hardcopy version was 
published in the December 1989 XNextEvent (the XUG newsletter).

In addition, Volume 3 (User's Guide) of the R4 flavor of the O'Reilly 
X Window System series contains an appendix listing xterm control sequences;
it is less accurate than the information in the R5 or R4 sources.

In a pinch, a VT100 manual will do.

Subject:  32)* How do I keep my $DISPLAY when I rlogin to another machine?

	There are several ways to avoid having to do a "setenv DISPLAY ..."
whenever you log in to another networked UNIX machine running X.
	One solution is to use the clients/xrsh on the R5 contrib tape.  It 
includes xrsh, a script to start an X application on remote machine, and
xrlogin, a script to start a local xterm running rlogin to a remote machine.
	One solution is to use the xrlogin program from der Mouse
(mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu). You can ftp caveat-emptor versions from
132.206.1.1, in X/xrlogin.c and X/xrlogind.c. The program packages up $TERM and
$DISPLAY into a single string, which is stuffed into $TERM.  rlogin then 
propagates $TERM normally; your .cshrc on the remote machine should contain
		eval `xrlogind`
where xrlogind is a program that checks $TERM and if it is of the special 
format it recognizes, unpacks it and spits out setenv and unsetenv commands to 
recreate the environment variables. [11/90]

	In addition, if all you need to do is start a remote X process on 
another host, and you find
		rsh <HOST> -n /usr/bin/X11/xterm -display $DISPLAY 
too simple (DISPLAY must have your real hostname), then this version of xrsh 
can be used to start up remote X processes. The equivalent usage would be 
		xrsh <HOST> xterm

  #! /bin/sh
  # start an X11 process on another host
  # Date: 8 Dec 88 06:29:34 GMT
  # From: Chris Torek <chris@mimsy.umd.edu>
  # rsh $host -n "setenv DISPLAY $DISPLAY; exec $@ </dev/null >&/dev/null"
  #
  # An improved version:
  # rXcmd (suggested by John Robinson, jr@bbn.com)
  #       (generalized for sh,ksh by Keith Boyer, keith@cis.ohio-state.edu)
  #
  # but they put the rcmd in ()'s which left zombies again.  This
  # script combines the best of both.
  
  case $# in
  [01])  echo "Usage: $0 host x-cmd [args...]";;
  *)
  	case $SHELL in
  	*csh*)  host="$1"; shift
  		xhost "$host" > /dev/null
  		rsh "$host" -n \
  			"setenv TERM xterm; setenv DISPLAY `hostname`:0; \
  			exec $* </dev/null >& /dev/null" &
  		;;
  	*sh)
  		host="$1"; shift

  			LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/X11/lib export LD_LIBRARY_PATH; \
  			PATH=\$PATH:/usr/X11/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/local/bin; \			export PATH; \

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  33)* How can I design my own font?

	One way is to use the "bitmap" client or some other bitmap-editor (e.g.
Sun's icon-editor tool, post-processed with pbmplus) to design the individual 
characters and then to do some large amount of post-processing to concatenate 
them into the BDF format. See Ollie Jones article in the November 91 "X Journal 
for more information.
	The R3 contrib/ area (in fonts/utils/ and in clients/xtroff) contained 
a number of useful utilities, including some to convert between BDF font format
and a simple character format which can be edited with any text editor.
	An easier way is to use the "xfed" client to modify an existing font; a
version is on the R4 or R5 X11R5 contrib tape in contrib/clients/xfed. Xfed is 
available for anonymous ftp on ftp.Informatik.Uni-Dortmund.DE [129.217.64.63], 
possibly as file /pub/windows/X/Diverse-X11-Sourcen/xfed.tar.Z.
	The xfedor client from Group Bull permits creation of bitmaps, cursors,
XPM1 pixmaps, and fonts. Binaries for common machines are on avahi.inria.fr in
/pub; in addition, the sources (an old Xlib implementation) have been placed 
[5/91] in export:/contrib. 
	If you are a MetaFont user you can use "mftobdf" from the SeeTeX
distribution to convert PK, GF, and PXL fonts to BDF format; the distribution
is on foobar.colorado.edu and on export.lcs.mit.edu.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  34)  Why does adding a font to the server not work?

	After you have built the font using your system's font-compiler, 
installed it in some directory, and run `mkfontdir` or your system's equivalent
in that directory, be sure to use `xset +fp $dir` to add that full path-name to
the server's font-path, or if the directory is already in the path, use 
`xset fp rehash` so that the new fonts in that directory are actually found; it
is this last step that you're probably leaving out.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  35)  How do I convert a ".snf" font back to ".bdf" font?

	A tool called "snftobdf 1.4" is part of the bdftools package, which is 
available from export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/bdftools.tar.Z and from 
crl.nmsu.edu:pub/misc/bdftools.tar.Z. Sources have been posted to fj.sources on
JUNET and should be appearing on comp.sources.x. [2/91]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  36)  What is a general method of getting a font in usable format?

	der Mouse's getbdf is one solution; it connects to a server and 
produces a .BDF file for any font the server is willing to let it.  It can be 
used as an anything-to-BDF converter, but requires access to a server that can 
understand the font file, thus is both more and less powerful than other tools 
such as snftobdf. getbdf is on 132.206.1.1 in X/getbdf.c or available via mail 
from mouse@larry.McRCIM.McGill.EDU. [5/91]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  37)  How do I use HP ".scf" fonts on my MIT R4 server?

	The X server from HP uses fonts whose names have the .scf suffix. These
are just compressed .snf fonts which are produced with the normal bdftosnf 
program.  You should be able to uncompress the font and add it to your font 
area, possibly with a rename to .snf; or, as the MIT server can deal with 
.snf.Z fonts, a simple rename to .snf.Z may work.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  38)  How do I use DECwindows ".pcf" fonts on my MIT R4 server?

	The DECwindows server stores fonts in a ".pcf" format which is not
recognized by the X11R4 server. There are several "font extractor" tools that 
you can use to get the .pcf files from the DEC server and write the information
to a .bdf file, which you can then recompile to .snf fonts using the 
font-compiler from the MIT distribution; the bdftools package is reported to
contain such an extractor.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  39)  How do I use DECwindows fonts on my non-DECwindows server?

	The DECwindows fonts typically don't exist on a non-DEC installation,
but rewrite rules can be used to alias fonts used by DECwindows applications to
standard MIT fonts of similar characteristics and size. Pick up the file 
contrib/DECwindows_on_X11R4_font.aliases from export.lcs.mit.edu; this file is 
for a standard MIT R4 server.  It can also serve as a starting point for 
creating a similar aliases file for the Open Windows server or other servers 
which do not use the MIT font scheme.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  40)  How do I add ".bdf" fonts to my DECwindows server?

	The format of fonts preferred by DEC's X server is the ".pcf" format.
You can produce this compiled format from the .bdf format by using DEC's dxfc
font-compiler. Note that the DEC servers can also use raw .bdf fonts, with a
performance hit.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  41)  How can I set the backgroundPixmap resource in a defaults file?
I want to be able to do something like this:
	xclock*backgroundPixmap:      /usr/include/X11/bitmaps/rootweave

	You can't do this. The backgroundPixmap resource is a pixmap of the 
same depth as the screen, not a bitmap (which is a pixmap of depth 1). Because 
of this, writing a generic String to Pixmap converter is impossible, since 
there is no accepted convention for a file format for pixmaps. Therefore, 
neither the X Toolkit or the Athena widget set define a String to Pixmap 
converter, because there is no converter you cannot specify this value as a 
resource.  The Athena widget set does define a String to Bitmap converter for 
use in many of its widgets, however.
[courtesy Chris D. Peterson (now kit@ics.com), 4/90]

However:
	A specific converter which encapsulates much of the functionality of 
the xloadimage package by Jim Frost was posted 12/90 by Sebastian Wangnick 
(basti@unido.informatik.uni-dortmund.de); it permits loading of a number of 
image formats as a pixmap.

	The leading general-purpose format for pixmaps is the XPM format used 
by Groupe Bull in several of its programs, including the GWM window manager, by
AT&T in its olpixmap editor, and by ICS in its interface builder. XPM 
distribution, available on export as contrib/xpm.tar.Z, includes read/write 
routines which can easily be adapted to converters by new widgets which want to
allow specification of pixmap resources in the above manner.  See information
on the xpm-talk mailing list above. XPM 3.0c was announced in 10/91 and is
available from export.lcs.mit.edu and avahi.inria.fr; it should be on the R5
contrib tape.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  42)* Why does the R3 xterm, et al, fail against the R4 server?

	The value given to a window's do_not_propagate mask is the likely 
culprit.  R3 allowed bogus values to be set, and early version of both Andrew 
and Interviews did, as well. Similar problems also occur in the R3 Motif
PanedWindow widget.
	If it is impossible to fix client source -- and many systems still ship
the R3 xterm, use 'xset bc' to put the X11R4 server into bug-compatibility 
mode.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  43)  Why doesn't xlock work on my R4 server?

	The version of xlock that went out on the R4 contrib tapes was not
quite R4-conformant; when built and run, it will produce an X_GrabPointer
protocol error. This can be fixed by making the R4 server run in bug-
compatibility mode; just say `xset bc`. 
	xlock has been fixed since; in addition, a major revision just [10/90]
came out (to comp.sources.x) and can be used instead.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  44)  How can I have xclock or oclock show different timezones?

	One solution is xchron, in Volume 6 of comp.sources.x, which can show
the time for timezones other than the local one. 
	Alternatively, you can probably set the timezone in the shell from
which you invoke the xclock or oclock, or use a script similar to this:
	#!/bin/sh
	TZ=PST8PDT xclock -name "San Jose" 2> /dev/null &
	TZ=EST5EDT xclock -name "Cambridge" 2> /dev/null &

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  45)* I have xmh, but it doesn't do anything. Where can I get mh?

	The xmh mail-reader requires the Rand MH mail/message handling system,
which is not part of the UNIX software distribution for many machines. A list 
of various ftp, uucp, e-mail and US-mail sites for both xmh and MH is given in 
the monthly MH FAQ; one source is ics.uci.edu in the file pub/mh/mh-6.7.tar.Z.  
If you do not receive the comp.mail.mh newsgroup or the MH-users mailing list, 
you can request a copy from Bill Wohler <wohler@sap-ag.de>.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  46)  Why am I suddenly unable to connect to my Sun X server?
After a seemingly random amount of time after the X server has been started, no
other clients are able to connect to it.

	The default cron cleanup jobs supplied by Sun (for 4.0.3, at least)
delete "old" (unreferenced) files from /tmp -- including /tmp/.X11-unix, which 
contains the socket descriptor used by X. The solution is to add "! -type s" to
the find exclusion in the cron job.
[10/90]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  47)  Why can't I override translations? Only the first item works.

	You probably have an extra space after the specification of the first 
item, like this:
	basic*text.translations:  #override \
	Ctrl<Key>a:    beginning-of-line() \n\ 	
	Ctrl<Key>e:    end-of-line()
					      ^ extra space
The newline after that space is ending the translation definition.
[Thanks to Timothy J. Horton, 5/91]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  48)* How do I report bugs in X?

	Generally, report bugs you find to the organization that supplied you
with the X Window System. If you received the R5 source distribution directly 
from MIT, please read the file mit/bug-report for instructions. [Look in
mit/doc/bugs/bug-report in R4.]

[Thanks to Stephen Gildea <gildea@expo.lcs.mit.edu>, 5/91; 12/91]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  49)  Why don't the R5 PEX demos work on my mono screen?

The R5 sample server implementation only works on color screens, sorry.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  50)+ Why do I get "Warning: Widget class version mismatch"?

	This error, which typically goes on to say, "widget 11004 vs. 
intrinsics 11003" indicates that the header files you included when building 
your program didn't match the header files that the Xt library you're linking 
against was built with; check your -I include path and -L link-path to be sure.
	However, the problem also occurs when linking against a version of the 
X11R4 Xt library before patch 10; the version number was wrong. Some Sun 
systems, in particular, were shipped with the flawed version of the library, 
and applications which link against the library typically give the warnings you
have seen.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  51)  TOPIC: OBTAINING X AND RELATED SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  52)  Is X public-domain software?

	No. The X software is copyrighted by various institutions and is not 
"public domain", which has a specific legal meaning. However, the X 
distribution is available for free and can be redistributed without fee.
	Contributed software, though, may be placed in the public domain by
individual authors.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  53)+ How compatible are X11R3, R4, and R5? What changes are there?

The Release Notes for each MIT release of X11 specify the changes from the 
previous release.  The X Consortium tries very hard to maintain compatibility 
across releases.  In the few places where incompatible changes were necessary, 
details are given in the Release Notes.  Each X11 distribution site on the 
network also offers the Release Notes that go with the release they offer; the 
file typically can be found at the top of the distribution tree.

[Stephen Gildea, 1/92]

Subject:  54)* Where can I get X11R5 (source and binaries)?

Information about MIT's distribution of the sources on 6250bpi and QIC-24 tape 
and its distribution of hardcopy of the documents is available from

X11R5 source along with GNU code and comp.sources.x archives are available on
a ISO-9660-format CD-ROM, along with SPARC binaries, from Robert A. Bruce
at rab@sprite.Berkeley.EDU.

Binaries for X11R5, with shared libX11 and libXmu, for A/UX 2.0.1 are now 
available from wuarchive.wustl.edu:/archive/systems/aux/X11R5.  Patches for 
X11R5 compiled with gcc (but not shared libraries) are also available.
[John L. Coolidge (coolidge@cs.uiuc.edu, 10/91)]

Binaries by Rich Kaul (kaul@ee.eng.ohio-state.edu) for the Sun386i running 
SunOS 4.0.2 are available on dsinc.dsi.com (please only after-hours USA EST).

A binary tree for the Next by Douglas Scott (doug@foxtrot.ccmrc.ucsb.edu) is on
foxtrot.ccmrc.ucsb.edu; it is missing the server, though.

Also:

Binaries are available from Unipalm (+44 954 211797, xtech@unipalm.co.uk), 
probably for the Sun platforms. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  55)*  Where can I obtain patches to X11R5?

	The release of new public patches by the MIT X Consortium is announced
in the comp.windows.x.announce newsgroup.

	Patches themselves are available via ftp from export and from other
sites from which X11 is available. They are sometimes also distributed through 
the newsgroup comp.sources.x, with some lagtime.  Some source re-sellers may be
including patches in their source distributions of X11.

	People without ftp access can use the xstuff mail server. It now has 
8 patches for X11R5 [12/91]. Send to xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu the Subject line
		send fixes #
where # is the name of the patch (its single-digit number or a file name).

	Here are a few complications:
	1) fix 5 is in four parts; you need to request "5a", "5b", "5c" and 
"5d" separately.
	2) the file sunGX.uu, which was part of an earlier patch, was 
re-released with patch 7.
	3) fix 8 is in two parts; you need to request "8a" and "8b".

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  56)  What is the xstuff mail-archive?

	The xstuff server is a mail-response program. That means that you mail 
it a request, and it mails back the response.
	Any of the four possible commands must be the first word on a line. The 
xstuff server reads your entire message before it does anything, so you can 
have several different commands in a single message (unless you ask for help). 
The xstuff server treats the "Subject:" header line just like any other line 
of the message.
	The archives are organized into a series of directories and 
subdirectories.  Each directory has an index, and each subdirectory has an 
index. The top-level index gives you an overview of what is in the 
subdirectories, and the index for each subdirectory tells you what is in it.

	1) The command "help" or "send help" causes the server to send you a 
more detailed version of this help file.
	2) if your message contains a line whose first word is "index", then 
the server will send you the top-level index of the contents of the archive. If
there are other words on that line that match the name of subdirectories, then 
the indexes for those subdirectories are sent instead of the top-level index. 
For example, you can say "send index fixes" (or "index fixes"). A message that 
requests an index cannot request data.
	3) if your message contains a line whose first word is "send", then the
xstuff server will send you the item(s) named on the rest of the line. To name 
an item, you give its directory and its name. For example
                send fixes 1 3 4
	You may issue multiple send requests. The xstuff server contains many 
safeguards to ensure that it is not monopolized by people asking for large 
amounts of data. The mailer is set up so that it will send no more than a fixed 
amount of data each day. If the work queue contains more requests than the 
day's quota, then the unsent files will not be processed until the next day. 
Whenever the mailer is run to send its day's quota, it sends the requests out 
shortest-first.
	4) Some mailers produce mail headers that are unusable for extracting 
return addresses.  If you use such a mailer, you won't get any response.  If 
you happen to know an explicit path, you can include a line like
        path foo%bar.bitnet@mitvma.mit.edu
or
        path bar!foo!frotz
in the body of your message, and the daemon will use it.

	The xstuff server itself can be reached at xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu. If 
your mailer deals in "!" notation, try sending to 
{someplace}!mit-eddie!expo.lcs.mit.edu!xstuff.

Subject:  58)  Where can I obtain OSF/Motif?
	
	You can obtain either OSF/Motif source or binaries from a number of 
vendors. Motif 1.1, which began shipping this past August, is based on the 
R4 Intrinsics and is currently [12/91] at 1.1.4.
	An OSF/Motif source license must be obtained from OSF before source can
be obtained from the Open Software Foundation or any value-added vendor for
any version. Call the Direct Channels Desk at OSF at 617-621-7300 for ordering 
information.
	Various hardware vendors produce developer's toolkits of binaries, 
header files, and documentation; check your hardware vendor, particularly if
that vendor is an OSF member. 
	In addition, independent binary vendors produce Motif toolkits for
machines for which Motif is not supported by a vendor; the kits include varied 
levels of bug-fixing and support for shared libraries and are based on widely
divergent version of Motif:
	Quest (408-988-8880) sells kits for Suns, as well; 
	IXI (+44 223 462 131) offers kits for Sun3 and Sun4. 
	NSL (+33 (1) 43 36 77 50; requests@nsl.fr) offers kits for the Sun 3 
and Sun 4.
	Bluestone Consulting makes a kit for Sun systems.
	ICS (617-62-0060) makes several binary kits, notably for Sun, DEC.
	HP and DEC have announced support for Motif on Sun systems.
	Unipalm (+44-954-211-797) currently offers for Sun systems a Motif 
Development Kit including X11R4 and based on Motif 1.1.2. The US distributor is
Expert Object Corp (708-926-8500).
	BIM ships Motif 1.1 binaries for Suns. Shared library support is 
included. Contact Alain Vermeiren (av@sunbim.be) or Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be) 
at +32(2)759.59.25 (Fax : +32(2)759.47.95) (Belgium).
	Metro Link Inc. (305-970-7353, sales@metrolink.com; in Europe contact
ADNT, (33 1) 3956 5333, UniVision (UK) Ltd. (44) 628 82 22 81) ships an 
implementation of X11R4 and Motif 1.1.2 (including a shared-library 
implementation of libXm.a) for the 386/486 Unix market.  Motif 1.1.2 is 
also available for Sun Sparc based workstations.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  59)* Does Motif work with X11R4? X11R5?

	Applications based on OSF/Motif 1.0 will run against an R4 server if it
is set to bug-compatibility mode or if a patch (part of the 1.0.3 upgrade) to 
the XmPanedWindow code is obtained.

	Applications based on OSF/Motif 1.0 can be built or linked on a system 
with X11R4 libraries provided that the Motif version of the R3 Intrinsics is 
used; the R4 Xt should not be used with Motif 1.0 programs.

	Motif 1.1, available in source form from OSF as of August 1990, uses 
the "vanilla" X11R4 Intrinsics, where "vanilla" means "with just a few 
patches"; the file fix-osf which OSF distributes is obsoleted by MIT's patches 
15-17.  The file fix-osf-1.1.1 distributed with the 1.1.1 version or its 
subsequent modification needs to be applied after MIT fix-18, though.

	Motif 1.1.1 to 1.1.3 will work with X11R5 if X11R5 is compiled with
-DMOTIF_BC; 1.1.4 should work with the vanilla R5.
	
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  60)  Where can I obtain toolkits implementing OPEN LOOK?

	Sun's XView has a SunView-style API. A version is on the X11R4 tape;
version 2.0 is also available (as of 8/90) on export.lcs.mit.edu for anonymous 
ftp. 
	XView and X binaries for the Sun 386i ("roadrunner") are available for 
ftp from svin01.win.tue.nl (131.155.70.70), directory pub/X11R4_386i.
	Roell's X11R4 package for the 386 apparently includes XView 2.0 
binaries.
	Supported binaries of XView include: 

XView for non-Sun Platforms  (domestic and selected international vendors).
Several are also available from Sun; contact your local sales office.

Subject:  61)  Where can I obtain other X sources?

	The MIT Software Center ships the X Test Suite on tape.

	User-contributed software is distributed through the newsgroup
comp.sources.x, moderated by Dan Heller (argv@sun.com); also check that group 
for posting information.

	Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) has been creating a list of freely-
available X sources.  The list is stored on export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib as
x-source-list.Z. It lists the main storage locations for the program and 
international sites from which it may be ftp'ed.

	The machine export.lcs.mit.edu has a great deal of user-contributed
software in the contrib/ directory; a good deal of it is present in current or 
earlier versions on the X11R3 and X11R4 contrib tapes. There is a new directory
contrib/R4fixes/ for fixes to R4 contrib software. [Jim Fulton, 2/90]

	The material on giza.cis.ohio-state.edu, which tends to duplicate 
the export archives, is also available via anonymous UUCP from osu-cis, at TB+ 
and V.32 speeds.  Write to uucp@cis.ohio-state.edu (same as osu-cis!uucp) for 
instructions. [the archive is now maintained by Karl Kleinpaste]

	A new west-coast UUCP X11 Archive is administered by Mark Snitily 
(mark@zok.uucp) and contains the full X11R4 distribution, the XTEST
distribution, an entire archive of comp.sources.x and other goodies.
	The machine zok has a TB+ modem which will connect to 19.2K, 2400, 
1200 baud (in that order).  The anonymous UUCP account is UXarch with password 
Xgoodies.  The modem's phone number is 408-996-8285.
	A sample Systems (or L.sys) entry might be:
   		zok Any ACU 19200 4089968285 in:--in: UXarch word: Xgoodies
	To get a current listing of the files that are available, download
the file "/usrX/ls-lR.Z".
	A full subject index of the comp.sources.x files is available in the
file "/usrX/comp.sources.x/INDEX".
	The machine has just the one modem, so please do not fetch large 
amounts of data at one sitting.

Subject:  71)  Where can I get an "X terminal" server for my low-end Sun 3/50?

	Seth Robertson (seth@ctr.columbia.edu) has written Xkernel; the current
version [1.4 as of 8/91, 2.0 expected RSN] is on sol.ctr.columbia.edu 
[128.59.64.40] in /pub/Xkernel.gamma. It turns a Sun 3/50 into a pseudo- X 
terminal; most of the overhead of the operating system is side-stepped, so it 
is fairly fast and needs little disk space.
	A similar approach is to run the regular X server by making /etc/init
a shell script which does the minimal setup and then invokes Xsun, like this
script from mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.EDU:

#! /bin/sh

client xditview, and the contributed-but-well-maintained xtroff. An earlier 
version of xtroff also appeared on the R3 contributed source.
	In addition, the xman client can be used to preview troff documents
using the -man macros.

In addition:

	xproof, an X previewer for ditroff has been contributed by Marvin 
Solomon (solomon@cs.wisc.edu); version 3.5 is available on export in 
contrib/xproof*. 	[8/90]

	Elan Computer Group (CA: 415-964-2200) produces eroff, a modified 
troff implementation, and Elan/Express, an X11 eroff previewer.

	SoftQuad (416-963-8337; USA only 800-387-2777, mail@sq.uu.net or
mail@sq.com) offers SoftQuad Publishing Software, including a substantially-
rewritten troff formatter, a better intermediate language with backwards 
compatibility, and an X11[R3,R4] previewer. (This is the package adopted by 
AT&T's own MIS department, and used in and re-sold by many parts of AT&T).

Subject:  83)* Where can I obtain a WYSIWYG interface builder?

	A new release of the DIRT interface builder by Richard Hesketh works 
with X11R5 and includes some support for the Motif widget set. From the README:
  This builder allows the interactive creation and rapid prototyping of X user
  interfaces using the X Toolkit and a number of Widget Sets.  Dirt generates
  "Wc - Widget Creation" resource files and this distribution also includes the
  Widget Creation Library (version 1.06, with the exception of the demos and
  Mri/Ari source code) with the kind permission of its author David E. Smyth.
Check dirt.README, dirt.A2.0.tar.Z, and dirt.PS.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib.

	The InterViews 3.0-beta C++ toolkit contains a WYSIWIG interface 
builder called ibuild.  ibuild generates code for an InterViews application 
complete with Imakefile and an X-resource file. Documentation is 
/pub/papers/ibuild.ps.  on interviews.stanford.edu (36.22.0.175).

	Druid (Demonstrational Rapid User Interface Development) runs on SPARC 
machines using OSF/Motif 1.0; it is intended eventually to be a full UIMS but 
apparently now has only support for creating the presentation components, for 
which it generates C/UIL code. Info: Singh G, Kok CH, Ngan TY, "Druid: A System
for Demonstrational Rapid User Interface Development". Proc. ACM SIGGRAPH Symp 
on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST'90). ACM, NY, 1990, pp:167-177.

	In addition, these commercial products (unsorted) are available in 
final or prerelease form [the * following the product name indicates that the 
product is known to allow the designer to specify for each widget whether a 
particular resource is hard-coded or written to an application defaults file,
for at least one form of output]. Some are much more than user-interface tools;
some are full user interface management systems:

	In addition, Neuron Data (1 415 321-4488) makes Open Interface, a 
window-system-independent object toolkit which supports interfaces which are 
or resemble (supersets of) Mac, Windows, and Motif and Open Look; the package 
includes an interface builder.

	In addition, the GRAMMI builder for Ada (1-800-GRAMMI1) apparently 
includes X/Motif output.

	In addition, these non-WYSIWYG but related products may help for goals 
of rapid prototyping of the application interface:

	WCL: the Widget Creation Library. Basically describes the widget
hierarchy and actions in a resources file; available from fine archive servers
everywhere, including devvax.jpl.nasa.gov (128.149.1.143) in pub/. Wcl provides
a very thin layer over Xt without any internal tweaking.
	WINTERP: an Xlisp-based Motif toolkit allows for interpretive 
programming. The copy on the R4 tape is outdated; get a copy off export or 
email to winterp-source%hplnpm@hplabs.hp.com. 
	The Serpent UIMS permits the building of user-interfaces without 
specific knowledge of coding but with an understanding of attributes being set
on a particular [Motif] widget.  Beta Release 1.2 is available from 
ftp.sei.cmu.edu (128.237.1.13) and can be found in /pub/serpent.  Serpent is 
also available on export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.11) in /contrib/serpent. Email
questions can go to serpent@sei.cmu.edu. A commercial version of Serpent is
available as "Agora" from ASET, 221 Woodhaven Drive, Pittsburgh, PA 15228.
	Garnet is a Common Lisp-based GUI toolkit. Information is available 
from garnet@cs.cmu.edu.

Subject:  84)  Where can I find X tools callable from shell scripts?
I want to have a shell script pop up menus and yes/no dialog boxes if the user 
is running X.

	Several tools in the R3 contrib/ area were developed to satisfy these
needs: yorn pops up a yes/no box, xmessage displays a string, etc. There are
several versions of these tools; few, if any, have made it to the R4 contrib/ 
area, though they may still be available on various archive sites.
	In addition, Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) has posted the xmenu
package to comp.sources.x ("v08i008: xmenu") for 1-of-n choices.  [7/90]
	Two versions of XPrompt have been posted to comp.sources.x, the latter
being an unauthorized rewrite. [R. Forsman (thoth@reef.cis.ufl.edu), 1/91]
	There is a version of XMenu available from comp.sources.x; it is
being worked on and will likely be re-released.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  85)  Where can I get an X-based debugger?

	xdbx, an X interface to the dbx debugger, is available via ftp from 
export. The current [1/91] version is 2.1 patchlevel 2.
	An X interface to gdb called xgdb is also available as part of the gdb
distribution but hasn't been updated from R3 or from the older versions of gdb.
	Also, an X interface to gdb called xxgdb is more like xdbx 2.1.2. It
is part of comp.sources.x volume 11 [2/91]. mxgdb, a Motif interface to this
program by Jim Tsillas (jtsillas@bubba.ma30.bull.com), was posted 7/91 to
alt.sources; 1.1.2 is now available on export:~/contrib [1/92] and support
gdb 4.x.
	UPS is a source-level debugger which runs under the X11 and SunView
window systems on Sun and DEC platforms. It is available from export 
(18.24.0.11) as contrib/ups-2.31.tar.Z.

Also:
	MIPS produces a highly-customizable (WCL-based) Visual Debugger.
	You should be able to use Sun's dbxtool with its X11/NeWS server.
	The Saber-C (617-876-7636) source-level debugger includes an X-based 
interface; this essential programmer's tool run on most major platforms.
	AT&T offers the eXamine Graphical Interface, an X11 interface to dbx
and C++ dbx for Sun3 and Sun4 and sdb and sdb++ for 386 and 3B2 platforms. Call
1-508-960-1997 or contact examine@mvuxi.att.com for more information.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  86)  How can I "tee" an X program identically to several displays?

	There are several protocol multiplexer tools which provide for the 
simultaneous display of X clients on any number of machines.
	XMX (an X Protocol Multiplexor) is available from wilma.cs.brown.edu 
(128.148.31.66) as pub/xmx.tar.Z It works independently of the server and does
not affect the application being shared; it was developed for use in the
electronic classroom.
	SHX from Michael Altenhofen of Digital Equipment GmbH CEC Karlsruhe 
also does this; it is a "WYSIWIS" (What You See Is What I See) package in the 
context of a computer-based learning/training tool to provide online help from
remote tutors but is also useful for general window sharing. Information: 
shX@nestvx.enet.dec.com.  SHX can be found on export and 
		gatekeeper.dec.com:/pub/X11/contrib/shX.tar.Z, 
		crl.dec.com:/pub/X11/contrib/shX.tar.Z 
	XTrap is implemented as a server/library extension. It is available as:
		gatekeeper.dec.com      pub/X11/contrib/XTrap_v31.tar.Z
		export.lcs.mit.edu      contrib/XTrap_v31.tar.Z

Also:
	Hewlett-Packard Co. has a commercial product, "Shared X" which works 
under HP-UX currently on their 300 and 400 series workstations.  The product 
number is B2305A for the media and manuals and B2305L for the license.
Apparently it works by temporarily replacing the X server with a special one.

Subject:  87)  TOPIC: BUILDING THE X DISTRIBUTION [topic needs updating to R5]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  88)+  What's a good source of information on configuring the X build?

	This FAQ includes information on a number of "gotchas" that can bite 
you on particular system. However, the best source of general information on 
building the X11 release is found in the Release Notes. The file is bundled 
separately from the rest of the release, so if it's become separated from your 
sources you can FTP another copy separately: the file RELNOTES.[ms,PS,TXT] at 
the top of the distribution.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  89)+ Why doesn't my Sun with a cg6 work with R5?

	Apparently gcc is the problem; it seems to produce fine code for all
Sun displays except for the cgsix. The new sunGX.o distributed with patch7
may fix the problem.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  90)+ Why doesn't my Sun with SunOS 4.1 know about _dlsym, etc.?

	If you get errors with _dlsym _dlopen _dlclose undefined, link with 
libdl.a.  Add "-ldl" to your and eventually your site.def.  You may want to 
surround it with "-Bstatic -ldl -Bdynamic" if you add it to the EXTRA_LIBRARIES 
variable, since "syslibs" get added after EXTRA_LIBRARIES on the eventual 
compilation command; otherwise you may not have a shared libdl.  (Or compile 
the stubs shared.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  91)  Why can't gcc compile X11R4 on my SPARC?
I used gcc to compile the whole distribution, but I get several segmentation
faults when running X.

	Note first that gcc on RISC machines does not necessarily result in
any performance increase; it certainly is not as noticeable as it is on the
680x0 or VAX platforms.

	Here is the problem: gcc and cc use incompatible methods of passing 
structures as arguments and returning them as function values, so when 
gcc-compiled parts of X are linked with Sun-supplied functions that pass or 
return structs, run-time errors occur.  Affected programs include rgb and 
the server.

	This is from the GCC manual:

	On the Sparc, GNU CC uses an incompatible calling convention for 
	structures.  It passes them by including their contents in the argument
	list, whereas the standard compiler passes them effectively by 
	reference.

	This really ought to be fixed, but such calling conventions are not yet
	supported in GNU CC, so it isn't straightforward to fix it.

	The convention for structure returning is also incompatible, and
	`-fpcc-struct-return' does not help.

You can duck the problem either by using cc throughout or by using it for just
the routines which cause incompatibilities; the problem cannot be solved with 
compilation flags.  

	Files which need to be compiled using cc include:
		server/os/4.2bsd/oscolor.c 
		rgb/rgb.c

	In addition, several of the "inet_" functions use structs as args or
return values:  
		clients/xhost/xhost.c 
		clients/xauth/gethost.c. 
Calls to inet_addr in /lib/CLX/socket.c and lib/X/XConnDis.c are possibly 
harmless as they don't involve structs.

Subject:  92)  What are these I/O errors running X built with gcc?
When I try to run xinit or the Xsun server I get the error 
	"Getting interface configuration: Operation not supported on socket. 
	Fatal server bug! no screens found."

	Running the gcc fixincludes script apparently didn't work. You can do 
this simple test:

	#include <sys/ioctl.h>
	SIOCGIFCONF

Run that through cc -E and gcc -E.  The last line of output is the piece of 
interest; it should be identical (modulo irrelevant differences like 
whitespace).  If the gcc version has 'x' where the cc version has 'i', your 
fixincludes run didn't work for some reason or other; go back to your gcc
sources and run `fixincludes`; then rebuild the X distribution. If they are 
identical, try running a make clean in mit/server and rebuilding, just to make 
sure everything gets compiled with the proper include files.

Subject:  93)  What are these problems compiling X11R4 with "gcc -traditional"?

	There are known problems with gcc 1.38 which cause use of the 
-traditional to produce errors along the lines of "gcc: Program cpp got fatal 
signal 6". The fix is to upgrade to 1.39.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  94)  What are these problems compiling X11R4 on ISC?

	If you are building R4 with shared libraries, then you need to patch 
GCC to handle a shared lib problem with X386. The easiest way to do this is to 
ftp from suphys.physics.su.oz.au the Esix binaries for GCC (they run fine on 
ISC).  They have already been patched.  You have to use the added "-mnobss" 
switch for the shared lib problems you're experiencing with Roell's extra 
patches for X386 1.1b.  

[Thanks to Stephen Hite (shite@sinkhole.unf.edu), 7/91]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  95)  What are these problems compiling X11R4 on the older Sun3?
In mit/server/ddx/sun/sunCG3C.c, we have found "missing" defines for 
CG3AC_MONOLEN, CG3BC_MONOLEN, CG3AC_ENBLEN, CG3BC_ENBLEN. What should these be?

	The R4 Errata list distributed after X11R4 mentions that you can add
these lines to the file on older SunOS versions (e.g. 3.5) to compile:
        #define CG3AC_MONOLEN (128*1024)
        #define CG3AC_ENBLEN  CG3AC_MONOLEN
        #define CG3BC_MONOLEN CG3AC_MONOLEN
        #define CG3BC_ENBLEN  CG3AC_MONOLEN

	However, the Sun3 should not actually ever have the CG3 device, and so 
references to it can be removed from mit/server/ddx/sun/sunInit.c and the 
Imakefile.  [11/90]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  96)  What are these problems compiling the X server on SunOS 4.1.1?
The file <sundev/cg6reg.h> isn't being found.

	Sun omitted <sundev/cg6reg.h> from SunOS 4.1.1. Remove the #include 
from sunCG6C.c and replace it with the line 
	#define CG6_VADDR_COLOR   0x70016000
The file has changed from earlier versions of SunOS and should not be copied 
from another distribution.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  97)  What are these problems using R4 shared libraries on SunOS 4?
All of the executables that I try to run have the following results:
	ld.so: libXmu.so.4: not found
or even:
	ld.so: call to undefined procedure __GetHostname from 0xf776a96c

	If you are building with shared libraries on a Sun, remember that you 
need to run "ldconfig" as root after installing the shared libraries (if you've
installed X on a file-server, run it on the server's clients, too).  While 
building and installing the distribution, you need to be careful to avoid 
linking against any existing X shared libraries you might have (e.g. those 
distributed with OpenWindows).  You should make sure you do not have 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH set in your environment during the build or the installation.  
If you are going to keep xterm and xload as setuid programs, please note that 
the shared libraries must be installed in /usr/lib, /usr/local/lib, or 
/usr/5lib for these programs to work (or else those programs must be linked 
statically). [courtesy MIT X Consortium]
	Note also that the program mkfontdir is run as part of the build; it
attempts, however, to use the shared libraries before they have been installed.
You can avoid the errors by building mkfontdir statically (pass -Bstatic to
most C compilers).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  98)* How do I get around the SunOS 4.1 security hole?

	There is a security problem with certain R4 clients (xterm and xload)
running under SunOS 4.1 that have been installed setuid root and are using shared
libraries; to avoid the problem, do one of these:
	1) make the program non-setuid. You should consult your system
administrator concerning protection of resources (e.g. ptys and /dev/kmem) used
by these programs, to make sure that you do not create additional security 
problems at your site.
	2) relink the programs statically (using -Bstatic).
	3) install the libraries before linking and link with absolute paths
to the libraries.

[from rws@EXPO.LCS.MIT.EDU (Bob Scheifler), 12/90]

The R5 version of xterm does this automatically by rebuilding xterm against the 
newly-installed libraries when xterm is being installed; this prevents an suid
program from being built with libraries specified relatively. Note that this 
may cause an inconvenience when doing the installation from NFS-mounted disks. 
Xload has been rewritten to avoid the problem.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  99)  TOPIC: BUILDING X PROGRAMS [topic needs updating to R5]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 100)* What is Imake?

	Imake is not a replacement for the make program; instead, it is a
makefile-generator that takes advantages of the include-file and macro-
processing capabilities of the C preprocessor cpp to generate makefiles 
suitable for building software on a particular system. Although it is not 
specific to X, the X release uses it to help solve a number of the 
configuration issues that arise in making such a large system widely portable.
	Imake has a fairly steep learning curve, in part because the process by
which the system-specific configuration files, system-independent configuration
files, and individual Imakefiles are melded to produce a Makefile is not 
obvious.
	There have been several different versions of imake; the R3, R4, and
R5 versions are different.

	You can obtain information on imake from these sources:
	- Paul Dubois (dubois@primate.wisc.edu) has written a useful 
explanation of how Imake works and how to use it in configuring X for non-
supported systems; the document is available from ftp.primate.wisc.edu
in the directory ~ftp/pub/imake-stuff; look for config-X11R4.ms (troff) and 
config-X11R4.ps (PostScript). Some supplemental appendices are nearby. 
[7/91: document version is now 1.06]
	- the R4 and R5 release notes and imake man page include information on
using Imake to build X
	- the R4 and R5 file mit/config/README also contains useful information
	- on the R4 tapes, contrib/doc/imake/imake.tex is Mark Moraes' R3/R4
guide to imake.
	- see "System Administration - Imake: Friend of Foe?" by Dinah McNutt
in the November 1991 issue of SunExpert.
[1/91;12/91]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 101)* Where can I get imake?

	Versions are distributed with the R4 and R5 releases. An earlier 
version is distributed with the X11R3 release; some third-party toolkits 
redistribute versions of imake along with their own implementations of the 
template and configuration files. There are no real standards for such 
configuration files, although most *current* contributed software expects the 
templates distributed with X11R5.
	export contains the R5 distribution unpacked, so you can pick up imake
without picking up the entire distribution.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 102)  I have a program with an Imakefile but no Makefile. What to do?

	If you have R4/5 installed on your system, run "xmkmf". This is a 
script which runs imake for you with the correct arguments. The output is a 
Makefile configured for your system and based on the Imakefile. Then run make, 
which will use that new Makefile to compile the program.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 103)  Why can't I link to the Xlib shape routines?
When I try to compile certain programs, I get the following link error:
	Undefined:
	_XShapeQueryExtension
	_XShapeCombineMask

	These routines are actually part of the Shape Extension to X (SHAPE)
which was introduced in the MIT X11R4 distribution and allows non-rectangular
windows.  Like the other sample server extensions, the shape extension will 
only run on a server which supports it.  Pre-X11R4 servers, as well as many 
vendor-supplied servers, do not support the shape extension, in which case 
they will display rectangular windows anyway.

	In order to use the shape extension, you must link to the library 
libXext.a.  In the X11R4 distribution, this library and the associated includes
will be in the mit/extensions directory.  If you do not have these files, do 
not despair:  many freeware programs which use the shape extension can also be 
compiled without it by removing the -DSHAPE define from the Makefile; you can
probably do this and compile successfully against your older vendor-supplied X 
libraries.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 104)  What are these problems with "_XtInherit not found" on the Sun?
When I run a X program that I wrote on a SunOS 4.0.3 or 4.1 machine I get the 
error "ld.so: symbol not found _XtInherit".

	What you are seeing is a side-effect of a kludge in the R4 libXt.a to 
get Sun shared libraries working.  Apparently, you can't share a function that 
is both called and compared, as _XtInherit is. This was handled by putting 
_XtInherit in the same file as a function that is always used, thereby 
guaranteeing that it would be loaded -- that is, in Initialize.c, where 
XtToolkitInitialize() and XtInitialize() reside. These routines would normally
be called.

	You are probably seeing this error because your program is not a normal
Xt-based program and does not call XtToolkitInitialize() anywhere. 
	1) it may be a program that uses Xt functions but never opens a 
connection to the X server.  [OSF/Motif's 1.1.0 UIL had this problem; it called
XtMalloc() and other Xt functions.] The solution is to add the call to your 
program; the function does not have to be executed, just linked in.
	2) alternatively, your program doesn't need any Xt functions and is
correct in not calling XtToolkitInitialize() -- it may be an Xlib or XView 
program. In this case, you can remove -lXt from your link command. 

	It should not be necessary to link the shared libraries statically,
although this will certainly solve the problem.

Subject: 105)  Why can't I compile my R3 Xaw contrib programs under the new X?
I have a program that worked well under X11R3. When I try to link it under 
the current version of X, I get this message:
	Undefined:
	_XtScrollBarSetThumb
	_XtTextSetInsertionPoint
	_XtTextReplace

	There were several name changes in the Athena widget set (in addition
to the header files moving into <X11/Xaw/>); these are mentioned in the R4
release notes. In this case, these functions are not really Xt functions but

Subject: 106)  TOPIC: PROGRAMMING PROBLEMS AND PUZZLES
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 107)  Why doesn't my program get the keystrokes I select for?

	The window manager controls how the input focus is transferred from one
window to another.  In order to get keystrokes, your program must ask the
window manager for the input focus.  To do this, you must set up what are
called "hints" for the window manager.  If your applications is Xlib-based, you
can use something like the following:

        XWMHints wmhints;
        ...
        wmhints.flags = InputHint;
        wmhints.input = True;
        XSetWMHints(dpy, window, &wmhints)

If your application is based on the Xt Intrinsics, you can set the XtNinput 
resource to be True (as you probably want to in any case); if you don't have
source, you can start up the application with the resource '*input:True'.

Certain window managers, notably dxwm and olwm, are very picky about having 
this done. 

	If you are using Sun's OpenWindows olwm, you can also add this resource
to your defaults file to use clients that aren't ICCCM-compliant.
	OpenWindows.FocusLenience:       true

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 108)  How do I figure out what window manager is running?

	You can't reliably tell; whatever mechanism you could use could be
spoofed in any case. 
	For most cases, you shouldn't care which window manager is running, so 
long as you do things in an ICCCM-conformant manner. There are some cases in 
which particular window managers are known to do things wrong; checking for
particular hints placed on the window by the window manager so that you can 
sidestep the problem may be appropriate in these cases. Alternatively, it may 
be appropriate to determine which window manager is running in order to take
advantage of specific *added* features (such as olwm's push-pin menus) in order
to give your program *added* functionality. Beware of usurping the window 
manager's functions by providing that functionality even when it is missing;
this surely leads to future compatibility problems.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 109)  Is there a skeleton X program available?
	
	There is no general framework such as the TransSkel program for the 
Macintosh which handles lots of the odds and ends and overhead of development 
under a window system and which can be used as a platform for additional 
development. In X, the problem is typically solved by using an interactive 
application builder tool or by using cut&paste on existing X applications. Good
applications which you might look to manipulate when you want to "test just 
this one little thing" include contrib/clients/xskel, a simple R4 program that 
puts up a window and allows sketching in it and offers a starting point for
quick hacks, the Xaw examples in the examples/ directory in the R3 and R4 
distributions, and the Xlib "Hello World" example in the R3 doc/HelloWorld and 
R4 doc/tutorials/HelloWorld; an updated version of this program which uses R4 
Xlib calls and current ICCCM conventions was posted in 2/90 to comp.windows.x  
by Glenn Widener of Tektronix. 	[3/90]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 110)  Why does XtGetValues not work for me?

	The XtGetValues interface for retrieving resources from a widget is
sensitive to the type of variable. Your code may be doing something like this:
	{
	Arg args[3];
	int i;
	int sensitive;		/* oops; wrong data type */
	i=0;
	XtSetArg (args[i], XtNsensitive, &sensitive); i++;
	XtGetValues(widget, args, i );
	...
	}

But XtNsensitive is a Boolean, which on most machines is a single byte; 
declaring the variable "sensitive" as Boolean works properly. This problem 
comes up often when using particular toolkits that redefine the Xt types 
Dimension and Position; code that assumes they are int will have similar 
problems if those types are actually short. In general: you are safe if you
use the actual type of the resource, as it appears in the widget's man page.
[11/90]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 111)  Why don't XtConfigureWidget/XtResizeWidget/XtMoveWidget work?

	You're probably trying to use these functions from application code.
They should be used only internally to widgets; these functions are for a 
parent widget to change the geometry of its children. Other promising 
functions, XtMakeGeometryRequest() and XtMakeResizeRequest(), are also for use 
only by widgets, in this case by a child to request a change from its parent.
	The only way for your application to request a geometry change for a
widget is to issue an XtSetValues call setting some of the geometry resources.
Although this will result in the widget-internal functions' being called, your
application code must use the standard XtSetValues interface or risk the 
widgets' data becoming corrupted.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 112)  How can my application tell if it is being run under X?

	A number of programs offer X modes but otherwise run in a straight
character-only mode. The easiest way for an application to determine that it is
running on an X display is to attempt to open a connection to the X server:
	
	display = XOpenDisplay(display_name);
	if (display)
		{ do X stuff }
	else
		{ do curses or something else }
where display_name is either the string specified on the command-line following
-display, by convention, or otherwise is (char*)NULL [in which case 
XOpenDisplay uses the value of $DISPLAY, if set].

This is superior to simply checking for the existence a -display command-line 
argument or checking for $DISPLAY set in the environment, neither of which is 
adequate. [5/91]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 113)  How do I make a "busy cursor" while my application is computing?
Is it necessary to call XDefineCursor() for every window in my application?

	The easiest thing to do is to create a single InputOnly window that is 
as large as the largest possible screen; make it a child of your toplevel 
window and it will be clipped to that window, so it won't affect any other 
application. (It needs to be as big as the largest possible screen in case the 
user enlarges the window while it is busy or moves elsewhere within a virtual 
desktop.) Substitute "toplevel" with your top-most widget here (similar code 
should work for Xlib-only applications; just use your top Window):

     unsigned long valuemask;
     XSetWindowAttributes attributes;

     /* Ignore device events while the busy cursor is displayed. */
     valuemask = CWDontPropagate | CWCursor;
     attributes.do_not_propagate_mask =  (KeyPressMask | KeyReleaseMask |
         ButtonPressMask | ButtonReleaseMask | PointerMotionMask);
     attributes.cursor = XCreateFontCursor(XtDisplay(toplevel), XC_watch);

     /* The window will be as big as the display screen, and clipped by
        its own parent window, so we never have to worry about resizing */
     XCreateWindow(XtDisplay(toplevel), XtWindow(toplevel), 0, 0,
         65535, 65535, (unsigned int) 0, CopyFromParent, InputOnly,
         CopyFromParent, valuemask, &attributes);

When you want to use this busy cursor, map and raise this window; to go back to
normal, unmap it. This will automatically keep you from getting extra mouse
events; depending on precisely how the window manager works, it may or may not
have a similar effect on keystrokes as well.

In addition, note also that most of the Xaw widgets support an XtNcursor 
resource which can be temporarily reset, should you merely wish to change the
cursor without blocking pointer events.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 114)  How do I query the user synchronously using Xt?
	
	It is possible to have code which looks like this trivial callback,
which has a clear flow of control. The calls to AskUser() block until answer
is set to one of the valid values. If it is not a "yes" answer, the code drops
out of the callback and back to an event-processing loop: 

	void quit(w, client, call)
		Widget          w;
		XtPointer client, call;
	{
		int             answer;
		answer = AskUser(w, "Really Quit?");
		if (RET_YES == answer)
			{
			answer = AskUser(w, "Are You Really Positive?");
			if (RET_YES == answer)
				exit(0);
                }
	}

	A more realistic example might ask whether to create a file or whether 
to overwrite it.
	This is accomplished by entering a second event-processing loop and
waiting until the user answers the question; the answer is returned to the
calling function. That function AskUser() looks something like this, where the 
Motif can be replaced with widget-set-specific code to create some sort of 
dialog-box displaying the question string and buttons for "OK", "Cancel" and 
"Help" or equivalents:

  int AskUser(w, string)
        Widget          w;
        char           *string;
  {
        int             answer=RET_NONE;	/* some not-used marker */
        Widget          dialog;			/* could cache&carry, but ...*/
        Arg             args[3];
        int             n = 0;
        XtAppContext    context;

        n=0;
        XtSetArg(args[n], XmNmessageString, XmStringCreateLtoR(string,
                XmSTRING_DEFAULT_CHARSET)); n++;
        XtSetArg(args[n], XmNdialogStyle, XmDIALOG_APPLICATION_MODAL); n++;
        dialog = XmCreateQuestionDialog(XtParent(w), string, args, n);
        XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNokCallback, response, &answer);
        XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNcancelCallback, response, &answer);
        XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNhelpCallback, response, &answer);
        XtManageChild(dialog);

        context = XtWidgetToApplicationContext (w);
        while (answer == RET_NONE || XtAppPending(context)) {
                XtAppProcessEvent (context, XtIMAll);
        }
        XtDestroyWidget(dialog);  /* blow away the dialog box and shell */
        return answer;
  }

	The dialog supports three buttons, which are set to call the same 
function when tickled by the user.  The variable answer is set when the user 
finally selects one of those choices:

  void response(w, client, call)
        Widget          w;
        XtPointer client;
        XtPointer call;
  {
  int *answer = (int *) client;
  XmAnyCallbackStruct *reason = (XmAnyCallbackStruct *) call;
        switch (reason->reason) {
        case XmCR_OK:
                *answer = RET_YES;	/* some #define value */
                break;
        case XmCR_CANCEL:
                *answer = RET_NO;
                break;
        case XmCR_HELP:
                *answer = RET_HELP;
                break;
        default:
                return;
        }
}

and the code unwraps back to the point at which an answer was needed and
continues from there.

Subject: 115)  How do I fork without hanging my parent X program?

	An X-based application which spawns off other Unix processes which 
continue to run after it is closed typically does not vanish until all of its 
children are terminated; the children inherit from the parent the open X 
connection to the display. 
	What you need to do is fork; then, immediately, in the child process, 
	close (ConnectionNumber(XtDisplay(widget)));
to close the file-descriptor in the display information. After this do your 
exec. You will then be able to exit the parent.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 116)  Why does XtAppAddInput not work as described?
I am using XtAppAddInput to read from a file, but the function is called even
when there isn't input pending.

	XtAppAddInput is actually working as it is supposed to. When used on
files, it is called whenever the file is READY to be read, not when there is
new data to be read. The file is almost always ready to be read, however, if 
only because you can spin back to the beginning and read data you've read 
before. The result is that your function will almost always be called every
time around Xt[App]MainLoop(). There is a way to get the type of interaction 
you are expecting; add this line to the beginning of your function to test 
whether there is new data:
	     if (ioctl(fd, FIONREAD, &n) == -1 || n == 0) return;
But, because this is called frequently, your application is effectively in a 
busy-wait; you may be better off not using XtAppAddInput and instead setting a 
timer and in the timer procedure checking the file for input.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 117)  How do I simulate a button press/release event for a widget?

	You can do this using XSendEvent(); it's likely that you're not setting
the window field in the event, which Xt needs in order to match to the widget
which should receive the event.
	 If you're sending events to your own application, then you can use 
XtDispatchEvent() instead. This is more efficient than XSendEvent() in that you
avoid a round-trip to the server.
	Depending on how well the widget was written, you may be able to call
its action procedures in order to get the effects you want.

Subject: 118)  Why doesn't anything appear when I run this simple program?

> ...
> the_window = XCreateSimpleWindow(the_display,
>      root_window,size_hints.x,size_hints.y,
>      size_hints.width,size_hints.height,BORDER_WIDTH,

> XMapWindow(the_display,the_window);
> ...
> XDrawLine(the_display,the_window,the_GC,5,5,100,100);
> ...

	You are right to map the window before drawing into it. However, the 
window is not ready to be drawn into until it actually appears on the screen --
until your application receives an Expose event. Drawing done before that will 
generally not appear. You'll see code like this in many programs; this code 
would appear after window was created and mapped:
  while (!done)
    {
      XNextEvent(the_display,&the_event);
      switch (the_event.type) {
	case Expose:	 /* On expose events, redraw */
		XDrawLine(the_display,the_window,the_GC,5,5,100,100);
		break;
	...
	}
    }

	Note that there is a second problem: some Xlib implementations don't 
set up the default graphics context to have correct foreground/background 
colors, so this program could previously include this code:
  ...
  the_GC_values.foreground=BlackPixel(the_display,the_screen);	/* e.g. */
  the_GC_values.background=WhitePixel(the_display,the_screen);	/* e.g. */
  the_GC = XCreateGC(the_display,the_window,
                GCForeground|GCBackground,&the_GC_values);
  ...
 
Note: the code uses BlackPixel and WhitePixel to avoid assuming that 1 is 
black and 0 is white or vice-versa.  The relationship between pixels 0 and 1 
and the colors black and white is implementation-dependent.  They may be 
reversed, or they may not even correspond to black and white at all.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 119)  What is the difference between a Screen and a screen?

	The 'Screen' is an Xlib structure which includes the information about
one of the monitors or virtual monitors which a single X display supports. A 
server can support several independent screens. They are numbered unix:0.0,
unix:0.1, unix:0.2, etc; the 'screen' or 'screen_number' is the second digit --
the 0, 1, 2 which can be thought of as an index into the array of available 
Screens on this particular Display connection.
	The macros which you can use to obtain information about the particular
Screen on which your application is running typically have two forms -- one
which takes a Screen and one with takes both the Display and the screen_number.
	In Xt-based programs, you typically use XtScreen(widget) to determine 
the Screen on which your application is running, if it uses a single screen.
	(Part of the confusion may arise from the fact that some of the macros
which return characteristics of the Screen have "Display" in the names -- 
XDisplayWidth, XDisplayHeight, etc.)

Subject: 120)* Can I use C++ with X11? Motif?
	
	The X11R4/5 header files are compatible with C++. The Motif 1.1 header 
files are usable as is inside extern "C" {...}. However, the definition of
String in Intrinsic.h can conflict with the libg++ or other String class and
needs to be worked around.

	Some other projects which can help, esp. with prototyped header files 
for other versions of X, include:
	- WWL, a set of C++ classes by Jean-Daniel Fekete to wrap X Toolkit 
widgets, available via anonymous FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu as 
contrib/WWL-1.1.tar.Z and lri.lri.fr (129.175.15.1) as pub/WWL-1.1.tar.Z.
It works by building a set of C++ classes in parallel to the class tree of the 
widgets.
	- X++, also a wrapper set, available from the University of Lowell
Graphics Research Laboratory/Motif. Contact Fran Ward at 508-934-3628.
	- THINGS,  a class library written at the Rome Air Force Base by the 
Strategic Air Command, available as freeware on archive sites.
	- HP C++ 2.0 with Motif 1.0. [2.1 is about to ship.]
	- InterViews 3.0 is now available as an alpha release [3/91].  It is 
obtainable via anonymous FTP from interviews.stanford.edu

Subject: 121)  How do I determine the name of an existing widget?
I have a widget ID and need to know what the name of that widget is.

	Users of R4 and later are best off using the XtName() function, which 
will work on both widgets and non-widget objects.

	If you are still using R3, you can use this simple bit of code to do 
what you want. Note that it depends on the widget's internal data structures 
and is not necessarily portable to future versions of Xt, including R4.

	#include <X11/CoreP.h>
	#include <X11/Xresource.h>
	String XtName (widget)
	Widget widget;	/* WILL work with non-widget objects */
	{

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 122)  What widget is appropriate to use as a drawing canvas?

	Some widget sets have a widget particularly for this purpose -- a
WorkSpace or DrawingArea which doesn't display anything but lets your Xt 
application know when it has been re-exposed, resized, and when it has received
user key and mouse input. 
	The best thing to do for other widget sets -- including the Athena set 
-- is to create or obtain such a widget; this is preferable to drawing into a 
core widget and grabbing events with XtAddEventHandler(), which loses a number 
of benefits of Xt and encapsulation of the functionality .  At least one 
version has been posted to comp.sources.x (name???). The publicly-available 
programs xball and xpic include other versions. And Chapter 7 of the Athena 
Widget manual includes a tutorial and source code to a simple Window widget 
which is suitable for use.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 123)  Why do I get a BadDrawable error drawing to XtWindow(widget)?
I'm doing this in order to get a window into which I can do Xlib graphics
within my Xt-based program:

> canvas = XtCreateManagedWidget ( ...,widgetClass,...) /* drawing area */
> ...
> window = XtWindow(canvas);	/* get the window associated with the widget */
> ...
> XDrawLine (...,window,...);	/* produces error */

	The window associated with the widget is created as a part of the 
realization of the widget.  Using a window id of NULL ("no window") could 
create the error that you describe.  It is necessary to call XtRealizeWidget() 
before attempting to use the window associated with a widget. 
	Note that the window will be created after the XtRealizeWidget() call, 
but that the server may not have actually mapped it yet, so you should also 
wait for an Expose event on the window before drawing into it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 124)  Can XGetWindowAttributes get a window's background pixel/pixmap?

	No.  Once set, the background pixel or pixmap of a window cannot be 
re-read by clients.  The reason for this is that a client can create a pixmap,
set it to be the background pixmap of a window, and then free the pixmap. The 
window keeps this background, but the pixmap itself is destroyed.  If you're 
sure a window has a background pixel (not a pixmap), you can use XClearArea() 
to clear a region to the background color and then use XGetImage() to read 
back that pixel.  However, this action alters the contents of the window, and 
it suffers from race conditions with exposures. [courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD 
and Stuart Marks of Sun]

	Note that the same applies to the border pixel/pixmap. This is a 
(mis)feature of the protocol which allows the server is free to manipulate the
pixel/pixmap however it wants.  By not requiring the server to keep the 
original pixel or pixmap, some (potentially a lot of) space can be saved.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 125)  Why doesn't GXxor produce mathematically-correct color values?

	When using GXxor you may expect that drawing with a value of black on a
background of black, for example, should produce white. However, the drawing
operation does not work on RGB values but on colormap indices. The color that
the resulting colormap index actually points to is undefined and visually
random unless you have actually filled it in yourself. [On many X servers Black
and White often 0/1 or 1/0; programs taking advantage of this mathematical
coincidence will break.]
	If you want to be combining colors with GXxor, then you should be 
allocating a number of your own color cells and filling them with your chosen
pre-computed values.
	If you want to use GXxor simply to switch between two colors, then you 
can take the shortcut of setting the background color in the GC to 0 and the
foreground color to a value such that when it draws over red, say, the result 
is blue, and when it draws over blue the result is red. This foreground value 
is itself the XOR of the colormap indices of red and blue.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 126)  Why does every color I allocate show up as black?

	Make sure you're using 16 bits and not 8.  The red, green, and blue 
fields of an XColor structure are scaled so that 0 is nothing and 65535 is 
full-blast. If you forget to scale (using, for example, 0-255 for each color) 
the XAllocColor function will perform correctly but the resulting color is 
usually black.

Subject: 127)  Why does the pixmap I copy to the screen show up as garbage? 

	The initial contents of pixmaps are undefined.  This means that most
servers will allocate the memory and leave around whatever happens to be there 
-- which is usually garbage.  You probably want to clear the pixmap first using
XFillRectangle() with a function of GXcopy and a foreground pixel of whatever 
color you want as your background (or 0L if you are using the pixmap as a 
mask). [courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 128)  How can my application iconify itself?

	The ICCCM provides a mechanism for this; your application sends a
client message which includes a data value indicating that it wishes to be
iconified.  Here is a sample callback that will iconify the application shell, 
wait 3 seconds, and pop it back up. Note that ApplicationShellWidget below
is global; it would make more sense in real use to walk up the tree via 
XtParent() to find the shell containing the active widget.

   void IconifyShell(w, d1, d2)
        Widget w;
        caddr_t d1, d2;
   {
     XClientMessageEvent event;
     Window win;
     Display *dpy;

     event.type = ClientMessage;
     event.send_event = True;
     dpy = event.display = XtDisplay(w);
     win = event.window = XtWindow(ApplicationShellWidget);
     event.message_type = XInternAtom(dpy, "WM_CHANGE_STATE", False);
     event.format = 32;
     event.data.l[0] = IconicState;
     XSendEvent(dpy, DefaultRootWindow(dpy), False,
                SubstructureRedirectMask | SubstructureNotifyMask, &event);
     XFlush(dpy);
     sleep(3);

Subject: 129)  How do I check whether a window ID is valid?
My program has the ID of a window on a remote display. I want to check whether
the window exists before doing anything with it.

	Because X is asynchronous, there isn't a guarantee that the window 
would still exist between the time that you got the ID and the time you sent an
event to the window or otherwise manipulated it. What you should do is send the
event without checking, but install an error handler to catch any BadWindow 
errors, which would indicate that the window no longer exists. This scheme will
work except on the [rare] occasion that the original window has been destroyed

Subject: 130)  Why can't my program work with tvtwm or swm?

	A number of applications, including xwd, xwininfo, and xsetroot, do not
handle the virtual root window which tvtwm and swm use; they typically return 
the wrong child of root. A general solution is to add this code or to use it in
your own application where you would normally use RootWindow(dpy,screen):

/* Function Name: GetVRoot
 * Description: Gets the root window, even if it's a virtual root
 * Arguments: the display and the screen
 * Returns: the root window for the client
 */
#include <X11/Xatom.h>
Window GetVRoot(dpy, scr)
Display        *dpy;
int             scr;
{
Window          rootReturn, parentReturn, *children;
unsigned int    numChildren;
Window          root = RootWindow(dpy, scr);
Atom            __SWM_VROOT = None;
int             i;

  __SWM_VROOT = XInternAtom(dpy, "__SWM_VROOT", False);
  XQueryTree(dpy, root, &rootReturn, &parentReturn, &children, &numChildren);
  for (i = 0; i < numChildren; i++) {
	Atom            actual_type;
	int             actual_format;
	long            nitems, bytesafter;
	Window         *newRoot = NULL;

	if (XGetWindowProperty(dpy, children[i], __SWM_VROOT, 0, 1,
	    False, XA_WINDOW, &actual_type, &actual_format, &nitems,
            &bytesafter, (unsigned char **) &newRoot) == Success && newRoot) {
			root = *newRoot;
			break;
		}
	}

	return root;
}

version of xsetroot distributed with tvtwm. 2/91]

A header file by Andreas Stolcke of ICSI on export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/vroot.h 
functions similarly by providing macros for RootWindow and DefaultRootWindow;
code can include this header file first to run properly in the presence of a
virtual desktop.

Subject: 131)  Can I have two applications draw to the same window?

	Yes. The X server assigns IDs to windows and other resources (actually,
the server assigns some bits, the client others), and any application that 
knows the ID can manipulate the resource.
	The problem you face is how to disseminate the window ID to multiple 
applications. A simple way to handle this (and which solves the problem of the
applications' running on different machines) is in the first application to 
create a specially-named property on the root-window and put the window ID into 
it. The second application then retrieves the property, whose name it also
knows, and then can draw whatever it wants into the window.
	[Note: this scheme works iff there is only one instance of the first
application running, and the scheme is subject to the limitations mentioned
in the Question about using window IDs on remote displays.]
	Note also that you will still need to coordinate any higher-level 
cooperation among your applications. 
	Note also that two processes can share a window but should not try to 
use the same server connection. If one process is a child of the other, it 
should close down the connection to the server and open its own connection.

Subject: 132)  How do I keep a window from being resized by the user?

	Resizing the window is done through the window manager; window managers
can pay attention to the size hints your application places on the window, but 
there is no guarantee that the window manager will listen. You can try setting 
the minimum and maximum size hints to your target size and hope for the best.

Subject: 133)  How do I make text and bitmaps blink in X?

	There is no easy way.  Unless you're willing to depend on some sort of
extension (as yet non-existent), you have to arrange for the blinking yourself,
either by redrawing the contents periodically or, if possible, by playing games
with the colormap and changing the color of the contents.

Subject: 134)  How do I render rotated text?
	
	Xlib intentionally does not provide such sophisticated graphics 
capabilities, leaving them up to server-extensions or clients-side graphics
libraries.
	Your only choice, if you want to stay within the core X protocol, is to
render the text into a pixmap, read it back via XGetImage(), rotate it "by 
hand" with whatever matrices you want, and put it back to the server via 
XPutImage(); more specifically:
	1) create a bitmap B and write your text to it.
	2) create an XYBitmap image I from B (via XGetImage).
	3) create an XYBitmap Image I2 big enough to handle the transformation.
	4) for each x,y in I2, I2(x,y) = I(a,b) where 
		a = x * cos(theta) - y * sin(theta)
		b = x * sin(theta) + y * cos(theta)
	5) render I2
	Note that you should be careful how you implement this not to lose
bits; an algorithm based on shear transformations may in fact be better.
	The high-level server-extensions and graphics packages available for X 
also permit rendering of rotated text: Display PostScript, PEX, PHiGS, and GKS,
although most are not capable of arbitrary rotation and probably do not use the
same fonts that would be found on a printer.
	In addition, if you have enough access to the server to install a font
on it, you can create a font which consists of letters rotated at some
predefined angle. Your application can then itself figure out placement of each
glyph.

	InterViews (C++ UI toolkit, in the X contrib software) has support for
rendering rotated fonts in X.  It could be one source of example code.
[Brian R. Smith (brsmith@cs.umn.edu), 3/91]
	Another possibility is to use the Hershey Fonts; they are 
stroke-rendered and can be used by X by converting them into XDrawLine 
requests. [pensoft!eric@cs.utexas.edu, 10/91]

Subject: 135)* Why can't my program get a standard colormap?
I have an image-processing program which uses XGetRGBColormap() to get the 
standard colormap, but it doesn't work. 

	XGetRGBColormap() when used with the property XA_RGB_DEFAULT_MAP does 
not create a standard colormap -- it just returns one if one already exists.
Use xstdcmap or do what it does in order to create the standard colormap first.

Subject: 136)  What is the X Registry? (How do I reserve names?)

	There are places in the X Toolkit, in applications, and in the X
protocol that define and use string names. The context is such that conflicts
are possible if different components use the same name for different things.
	The MIT X Consortium maintains a registry of names in these domains:
orgainization names, selection names, selection targets, resource types,
application classes, and class extension record types; and several others.
	The list as of 1/90 is in the directory mit/doc/Registry on the R4 
tape.
	To register names (first come, first served) or to ask questions send 
to xregistry@expo.lcs.mit.edu; be sure to include a postal address for
confirmation.
