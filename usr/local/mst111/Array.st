Array comment: 
'My instances are objects that have array-like properties: they are directly 
indexable by integers starting at 1, and they are fixed in size.  I inherit
object creation behavior messages such as #with:, as well as iteration
and general access behavior from SequenceableCollection.' !

!Array methodsFor: 'basic'!
