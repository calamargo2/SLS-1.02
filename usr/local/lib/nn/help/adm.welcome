Welcome to the nn news reader				Release 

Unlike the other news readers you might be familiar with, the ultimate
goal of nn is "not to read news"; actually, "nn" is an acronym for "No
News", and the motto of nn is:

	No news is good news, but nn is better.

I hope that you will enjoy using nn.

Three levels of online help is available:
 ?	gives a quick reference guide for the current mode.
 :help	explains how to get help on specific subjects.
 :man	opens the online manual.

Use Q to quit nn.

Have fun,
