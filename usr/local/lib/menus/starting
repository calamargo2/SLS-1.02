Before you can install Linux on your hard drive, you must partition your
drive, and put a file system on it.  Roughly, this entails:

 - Create a Linux/Minix partition with "fdisk" on your hard drive and reboot.
 - Make a file system on the partition with "mkfs".
 - Use "doinstall /dev/PART", where PART is your partition, to start 
   the installation.  For example "doinstall /dev/hda2".

This last step will ask you to put a formatted floppy in the drive
so that BOOT DISK can be prepared for you, so have one ready ahead of time.  
When the installation is complete, and you reboot from this floppy, you 
will be using Linux from your hard drive.

Before you begin, however, you may wish to type "menu" and browse the
Instructions submenu.  But make sure you exit "menu" before you start
the install process.  You can also print files from there using "P",
or you can use "cat README > /dev/lp1" or "cat README > /dev/lp2".

Your first task after the base install is done, should be to make backup
copies of all of your disks  (Look in the "User Commands" menu).
In fact, you should make sure all disks are write protected first,
before you start the installation.
