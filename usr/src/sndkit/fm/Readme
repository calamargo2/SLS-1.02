This directory contains a couple of programs for playing standard 
standard MIDI -files (.MID). This version supports only format 0
(1 tracks). These programs are also capable to play .CMF -files.
If a CMF -file is played, it is first converted to a MIDI -file
(/tmp/cmf_file.mid) which is played. 

Program "midplay" can be used to play MIDI -files with an external
MIDI -synthesizer. It copies NoteOn, NoteOff and ProgramChange
-messages to the midi port.

Program "fmplay" plays a midi file with the FM synthesizer (AdLib).
You have to load the instruments to the kernel before using this program
(see ../README). This version of fmplay is still quite limited. It is suitable
just for verifying that the FM synthesizer works.
Version 0.2 contains major changes by Rob Hooft (hooft@chem.ruu.nl).

These programs are based on midifile -package made by
Michael Czeiszperger (czei@pan.com). The original package is included
in the midifile -subdirectory.
