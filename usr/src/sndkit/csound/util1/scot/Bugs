The following bugs and stuff should be noted about SCOT:

	The grammar allows parentheses groups inside parenthesis, although
the documentation doesn't mention the possibility.  The assignment of
notes to instrument copies is not particularly reasonable in such cases,
anyway.  A tree of instrument copies would be needed, not just a linear
chain.

	The Lex lexer is unnecessarily large.	It could be recoded by hand
in much less space.  However, it is elegant, and easy to play around with.
Maybe someone will produce a more efficient Lex someday ...

	Backups have a number of unpleasantries.  In particular, the
the following doesn't even produce a warning:
	4c<2d<4e 4f<4g<4a
Individual parts should be checked for alignment, and not only just at
barlines.  This is not quite so trivial as it might seem, because the
grammar has been modified to allow null notes in backups, making legal
the following very reasonable usage:
	4c<2d<4e  4f<<2g  4a<4b<  2c<2e<2g
That is, a null part in a backup keeps that instrument copy active.
This particularly affects the vertical inheritance of various
parameters:  when a copy is first allocated, it is essentially a clone
of the next-previous copy.  The code was modified to always deallocate
a copy as soon as it does not appear in a verticality.	If it reappears
in a later verticality, it reinherits all state information.  The code
used to be inconsistent in this matter.

	Backups also probably don't properly check uncompleted or
improper slurs in upper parts.

	Octave following off now works except for backups.
