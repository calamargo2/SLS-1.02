\fB=\fR (simple assignment) - Put the value of the expression
\fIiarg (karg, xarg)\fR into the named result.
This provides a means of saving an evaluated result for later use.

\fBinit\fR - Put the value of the I-time expression \fIiarg\fR into a K-
or A-variable, i.e., initialize the result.  Note that \fBinit\fR provides
the only case of an Init-time statement being permitted to write into a
Perf-time (K- or A-rate) result cell; the statement has no effect at
Perf-time.

\fBtival\fR - Put the value of the instrument's internal "tie-in" flag into
the named I-variable.  Assigns 1 if this note has been 'tied' onto a
previously held note (see I Statement); assigns 0 if no tie actually took
place.  (See also \fBtigoto\fR.)

\fBdivz\fR - Whenever \fIb\fR is not zero, set the result to the value of
\fIa/b\fR; when \fIb\fR is zero, set it to the value of \fIsubst\fR instead.
