These statements delimit an instrument block.  They must always occur in
pairs.



\fBinstr\fR - begin an instrument block defining instruments \fIi, j\fR, ...

\fIi, j\fR, ... must be numbers, not expressions.  Any positive integer
is legal, and in any order, but excessively high numbers are best avoided.


\fBendin\fR - end the current instrument block.




Note:

There may be any number of instrument blocks in an orchestra.

Instruments can be defined in any order (but they will always be both
initialized and performed in ascending instrument number order).

Instrument blocks cannot be nested (i.e. one block cannot contain another).
