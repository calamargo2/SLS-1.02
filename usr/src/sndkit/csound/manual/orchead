These statements are global value \fIassignments\fR, made at the
beginning of an orchestra, before any instrument block is defined.
Their function is to set certain \fIreserved symbol variables\fR that are
required for performance.
Once set, these reserved symbols can be used in expressions anywhere in the
orchestra.

\fBsr\fR= (optional) - set sampling rate to \fIn1\fR samples per second
per channel.  The default value is 10000.

\fBkr\fR= (optional) - set control rate to \fIn2\fR samples per second.
The default value is 1000.

\fBksmps\fR= (optional) - set the number of samples in a Control Period.
\fBThis value must equal sr/kr\fR.  The default value is 10.

\fBnchnls\fR= (optional) - set number of channels of audio output to \fIn4\fR.
(1 = mono, 2 = stereo, 4 = quadraphonic.)  The default value is 1 (mono).



In addition, any \fBglobal variable\fR can be initialized by an \fIinit-time
assignment\fR anywhere before the first \fBinstr\fR statement.



All of the above assignments are run as instrument 0 (i-pass only)
at the start of real performance.


Example of header assignments:

.nf
	sr = 10000
	kr = 500
	ksmps = 20

gi1	=	sr / 2.
ga1	init	0
gitranspose  =	octpch(.01)
.bp
