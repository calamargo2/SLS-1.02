DURATION CONTROL STATEMENTS

.nf
		\fBihold\fR
		\fBturnoff\fR
.fi


These statements permit the current note to modify its own duration.



\fBihold\fR - this I-time statement causes a finite-duration note to become
a 'held' note.  It thus has the same effect as a negative p3 (see Score
I-statement), except that p3 here remains positive and the instrument
reclassifies itself to being held indefinitely.  The note can be turned off
explicitly with \fBturnoff\fR, or its space taken over by another note
of the same instrument number (i.e. it is tied into that note).
Effective at I-time only; no-op during a \fBreinit\fR pass.

\fBturnoff\fR - this P-time statement enables an instrument to turn itself
off.  Whether of finite duration or 'held', the note currently being
performed by this instrument is immediately removed from the active note
list.  No other notes are affected.






Example:


The following statements will cause a note to terminate when a control
signal passes a certain threshold (here the Nyquist frequency).

.nf
	k1	expon	440, p3/10, 880		;begin gliss and continue
		if	k1 < sr/2 kgoto contin	;  until Nyquist detected
 		turnoff 				;  then quit
contin:	a1	oscil	a1, k1, 1
