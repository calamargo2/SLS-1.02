Score Section
.PP
The Scot statements contained inside the braces of each score statement is
translated into a numeric score Section (q.v.).
It is wise to keep score sections small, say seven or eight measures
of five voices at a time.
This avoids overloading the system, and simplifies error checking.
.PP
The beginning of the score section is specified by typing:
.i
.ne 1
score {
.e
Everything which follows this until the braces are closed is within a single
section.  Within this section you write measures of notes in
traditional pitch and rhythm notation for any of the instrument names listed
in your orchestra declaration. These notes may carry additional information
such as slurs, ties and parameter fields.  Let us now consider the format for
notes entered in a Scot score.
.PP
The first thing to do is name the instrument you want and the desired meter.
For example, to write some 4/4 measures for the cello, type:
.i
.ne 2
$cello
!ti "4/4"
.e
The dollar sign and exclamation point tell Scot that a special
declarator follows. The time signature declarator is optional;  if present,
Scot will check the number of beats in each measure for you.
.SH
Pitch and Rhythm
.PP
The two basic components of a note statement are the pitch and duration.
Pitch is specified using the alphabetic note name, and duration is
specified using numeric characters.
Duration is indicated at the beginning of the note as a number representing
the division of a whole beat.
You may always find
the number specifying a given duration by thinking of how many times that
duration would fit in a 4/4 measure.  Also, if the duration is followed by
a dot (`.') it is increased by 50%, exactly as in traditional notation.
Some sample durations are listed below:
.ne 6
.i
whole note		1
half note    		2
double dotted quarter	4..
dotted quarter note	4.
quarter note		4
half note triplet      	6
eighth note  		8
eighth note triplet    	12
sixteenth note		16
thirty-second note    	32
.e
.PP
Pitch is indicated next by first (optionally) specifying the register
and then the note name, followed by an accidental if desired.
Normally, the "octave following" feature is in effect.  This
feature causes any note named to lie within the interval of
an augmented fourth of the previous note, unless a new register is chosen.
The first note you write will always be within a fourth of middle c
unless you choose a different register.
.PP
For example, if the first note of an instrument part is notated g flat,
the scot program assigns the pitch corresponding to the g flat below middle
c.  On the other hand, if the first note is f sharp, the pitch assigned will
be the f sharp above middle c.  Changes of register are indicated
by a preceding apostrophe for each octave displacement upward or a preceding
comma for each octave displacement downward.  Commas and apostrophes always
displace the pitch by the desired number of octaves starting from that note
which is within an augmented fourth of the previous pitch.
.PP
If you ever get lost, prefacing the pitch specification with an `='
returns the reference to middle c.  It is usually
wise to use the equals sign in your first note statement and whenever you
feel uncertain as to what the current registration is.  Let us now write
two measures for the cello part, the first starting in the octave below
middle c and the second repeating but starting in the octave above middle c:
.i
.ne 3
$cello
!ti "4/4"
4=g 4e 4d 4c/ 4='g 4e 4d 4c
.e
.pg
As you can see, a slash indicates a new measure and we have chosen to use
the dummy middle c to indicate the new register.  A more convenient way of
notating these two measures would be to type the following:
.i
.ne 3
$cello
!ti "4/4"
4=g e d c/ ''g e d c
.e
You may observe in this example that the quarter note duration carries to the
following notes when the following durations are left unspecified.
Also, two apostrophes indicate an upward pitch displacement of two
octaves from two g's below middle c, where the pitch would have fallen
without any modification.  It is important to remember three things, then, when
specifying pitches:
.i
.ne 11
1)  Note pitches specified by letter name only (with or without
    accidental) will always fall within an interval of a fourth
    from the preceding pitch.

2)  These pitches can be octave displaced upward or downward
    by preceding the note letter with the desired number of
    apostrophes or commas.

3)  If you are unsure of the current register, you may begin
    the pitch component of the note with an equals sign which
    acts as a dummy middle c.
.e
.PP
The pitch may be modified by an accidental after the note name:
.i
n			natural
#			sharp
-  (hyphen)	  	flat
##			double sharp
-- (double hyphen)   	double flat
.e
Accidentals are carried throughout the measure just as in
traditional music notation.  However, an accidental
specified within a measure will hold for that note in all registers,
in contrast with traditional notation.  Therefore, make sure to specify
.I n
when you no longer want an accidental applied to that pitch-class.
.PP
Pitches entered in the Scot score are translated into the appropriate octave
point pitch-class value and appear as parameter p5 in the numeric score
output.  This means you must design your instruments to accept p5 as pitch.
.PP
Rests are notated just like notes but using the letter
.I r
instead of a pitch name.
.I 4r
therefore indicates a quarter rest and
.I 1r
a whole rest.  Durations carry from rest to rest or to following pitches
as mentioned above.
.PP
The tempo in beats per minute is specified in each section
by choosing a single instrument part and using tempo statements (e.g. t90)
at the various points in the score as needed.
A quarter note is interpreted as a single beat, and tempi are interpolated
between the intervening beats (see score
.B t
statement).
