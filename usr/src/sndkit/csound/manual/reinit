These statements permit an instrument to reinitialize itself during
performance.




\fBreinit\fR - whenever this statement is encountered during a P-time pass,
performance is temporarily suspended while a special Initialization pass,
beginning at \fIlabel\fR and continuing to \fBrireturn\fR or \fBendin\fR,
is executed.  Performance will then be resumed from where it left off.

\fBrigoto\fR - similar to \fBigoto\fR, but effective only during a
\fBreinit\fR pass (i.e., No-op at standard I-time).  This statement is
useful for bypassing units that are not to be reinitialized.

\fBrireturn\fR - terminates a \fBreinit\fR pass (i.e., No-op at standard
I-time).  This statement, or an \fBendin\fR, will cause normal performance
to be resumed.






Example:

The following statements will generate an exponential control signal
whose value moves from 440 to 880 exactly ten times over the duration p3.


.nf
reset:		timout	  0, p3/10, contin     	;after p3/10 seconds,
		reinit	  reset			;  reinit both timout
contin:	k1	expon	  440, p3/10, 880		;  and expon
		rireturn				;  then resume perf
