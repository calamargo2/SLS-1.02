Groupettes
.PP
Duration numbers can have any integral value; for instance,
.i
!time "4/4"
5cdefg/
.e
would encode a measure of \fI5 in the time of 4\fR quarter notes.
However, specification of arbitrary rhythmic groupings in this way
is at best awkward.  Instead, arbitrary portions of the score section
may be enclosed in \fIgroupette brackets.\fR
The durations of all notes inside groupette brackets will be multiplied
by a fraction
.I n/d,
where the musical meaning is
.I d
in the time of
.I n.
Assuming
.I d
and
.I n
here are integers, groupette brackets may take these several forms:
.i
{d:n:	.....	:}     d in the time of n
{d::	.....	:}     n will be the largest power of 2 less than d
{:	.....	:}     d=3, n=2 (normal triplets)
.e
It can be seen that the second and third form are abbreviations
for the more common kinds of groupettes.
(Observe the punctuation of each form carefully.)  Groupettes may be nested
to a reasonable depth.  Also, groupette factors apply only after the written
duration is carried from note to note.  Thus, the following
example is a correct specification for two measures of 6/8 time:
.i
!time "6/8" 8cde {4:3: fgab :} / crc 4.c /
.e
The notes inside the groupette are
.I 
4 in the space of 3
.R
8th notes,
and the written-8th-note duration carries normally into the next measure.
This closely parallels the way groupette brackets and note durations
interact in standard notation.

Slurs and Ties
.PP
Now that you understand part writing in the Scot language, we
can start discussing more elaborate features.  Immediately following
the pitch specification of each note, one may indicate a slur or a tie
into the next note (assuming there is one), but not both simultaneously.
The slur is typed as a single underscore (`_') and a tie as a double
underscore (`__').  Despite the surface similarity, there is a substantial
difference in the effect of these modifiers.
.PP
For purposes of Scot, tied notes are notes which, although comprised
of several graphic symbols, represent only a single musical event.
(Tied notes are necessary in standard music notation for several reasons,
the most common being notes which span a measure line and notes
with durations not specifiable with a single symbol, such as quarter
note tied to a sixteenth.)
Notes which are tied together are summed by duration and output by Scot as
a single event.
This means you cannot, for example, change the parameters of a note
in the middle of a tie (see below).  Two or more notes may be tied together,
as in the following example, which plays an f# for eleven beats:
.ne 3
.i
!ti "4/4"
1 f#__ / 1 f#__ / 2. f# 4r /
.e
.pg
By contrast, slurred notes are treated as distinct notes at the
.B Csound
level, and may be of arbitrary pitch.  The presence of a slur is reflected
in parameter p4, but the slur has no other meaning beyond the
interpretation of p4 by your instrument.  Since instrument design
is beyond the scope of this manual, it will suffice for now to explain that
the Scot program gives sets p4 to one of four values depending
on the existence of a slur before and after the note in question.  This
means Scot pays attention not only to the slur attached to a given note,
but whether the preceding note specified a slur.  The four possibilities
are as follows, where the p4 values are taken to apply to the note `d':
.i
.ne 4
4c  d	    (no slur)		p4 = 0
4c  d_	    (slur after only)  	p4 = 1
4c_ d	    (slur before only)	p4 = 2
4c_ d_	    (before & after)   	p4 = 3
.e
