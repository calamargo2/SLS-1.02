This directory contains test orchestra and score files, made during
development.  Usually a couple of seconds in length, and designed to
exercise some feature of the language.
There is one .scot score;  the remainder are in standard score format.
The files are runnable in pairs under the csound command, e.g:

		csound [flags] test.orc test.sco

N.B. adsyn.orc, lp.orc & pvoc.orc use the files adsyn.1, lp.1 & pvoc.1,
respectively.   These are 'control files' made by audio analysis programs
(see the man pages on hetro, lpc & pvanal.), and contain binary data in
16-bit integers (adsyn.1) or header-controlled 32-bit floats (lp.1, pvoc.1).
These binary files are in DEC's byte-reversed format, and will run 'as is'
only on Digital Equipment machines.  More specifically, the float files
lp.1, pvoc.1 are formatted in DEC-RISC format; to run on a standard VAX
they must first be 'vaxified', e.g.,

		vaxify -h lp.1 lp.1.vaxed

The integer file adsyn.1 will run on either DEC-RISC or VAX machines.
To use any of these (int or float) on non-DEC machines, first run 'undec', e.g.

		undec -h pvoc.1 pvoc.1.undec
