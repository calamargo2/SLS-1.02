This directory contains orchestra and score files, *.orc/ and *.sco
They are runnable in pairs under the csound command, e.g:

		csound [flags] test.orc test.sco

The JD, JN and RB orc/sco files are fragments of original pieces by composers
Jim Dashow, Jon Nelson and Richard Boulanger, who are expert Csound users.
Files are about a minute each, and will take several minutes to synthesize.
Usual copyrights apply.
Note that these orchestra sample_rates are set for high-speed, variable DACS.
For other sample_rates the orchestra SR must be modified;  some aliasing may occur.

The other scores are transciptions of traditional works, kept simple enough to
run in realtime if your machine has output dacs and is fast enough, e.g. > 3 Mflops.
Orchestras have been modified to presume a standard dac sample_rate of 8192.
If this all fits your situation, you can play one of these score by something like:

		csound -uho stdout bach.* > /dev/audio
	or	csound -uho /dev/audio bach.*
