History:
-------
soundtracker was originally written by Karsten Obarsky for the amiga, a
loong time ago. There have been numerous variants built upon it, the
latest being protracker.

Liam Corner had the original idea of a player for the sunstation, and
proved that it was possible. 
I wouldn't have thought of writing it myself, but armed with his original code, 
I used my knowledge of the amiga tracker format to `add some improvements'. 
Of course, I ended up rewriting the whole code. At that point, it ran on 
silicon graphics indigos and suns.

Steve Haehnichen wrote a soundblaster variant of that program which I have 
finally added to the other versions. I did not have any news from him for
sometime now, so I've decided to distribute it all. If it doesn't work as it is,
it shouldn't be difficult to fix. 

Hannu Savolainen sent me the linux version and helped me put it up to date.
This one should work.

Many thanks also to Matthew Donaldson and Joerg-Cyril Hoehle for sending me 
very useful bug reports and giving us an ever better sounding player !
Also, thanks to Loic Grenie, whose unix expertise I used extensively to
get bg/fg routines to `work' (remaining bugs are mine, of course).


I also heard of some variants on the NeXt which I have been too busy to get
yet. 

If you want to modify tracker or make it run on another machine, or correct
problems, please do so.
HOWEVER, IF YOU INTEND TO PORT IT TO ANOTHER MACHINE, I WOULD VERY MUCH
APPRECIATE THAT YOU CHECK UP WITH ME FIRST. 
There just might already be a port in progress, or I might have a newer
version. Even so, I'd like to be able to maintain one source instead of
a bazillion of version. My e-mail is espie@ens.fr, not liable to change
for some time.

IMPORTANT NOTE
--------------
I am afraid I won't be able to follow up on the program, nor on my e-mail
for the ten months to come. So if  you don't get any answers from me for some
time, that's quite normal, you're on your own...

PRELIMINARY
-----------
As I am a lazy person, this file tends to change more slowly than the tracker
program itself.  Some options may no longer exist, some may have been added.
Many things may be different.  I mainly try to get out a working, efficient
reasonably bug-free program.  If I manage to write corresponding docs, fine !
If I don't, tough luck ! Anyhow, looking at the source file should provide
you with enough insight for everything.

This is tracker version 3.9. It includes numerous bug-fixes, a much better
command line interface and runtime interface, and improved support for 
compressed formats--thanks to Steve for this.  As this version was not tested
on soundblaster PC, you might need to do some tweaking around to make it 
work for such a machine. If you would be kind enough as to send me 
any requested changes, I would appreciate it. Thanks to Hannu Savolainen for
helping me getting the linux version upto date.

To build tracker, you should have a good look at the makefile.
Usually, just changing the install dir, doing a make machine_name, then
make install should be enough.  You may want to install tracker by hand,
as it is trivial.

tracker is a public domain program, it is not guaranteed to do anything
at all, either useful or useless. You've been warned, use it at your own risk. 
This said, there doesn't seem to be any relevant bugs left in the current
revision of code, and it is getting more and more stable.

``Soundtracker'' is a family of music composition programs
that exists on the amiga. The resulting data files (modules)
have been appearing on ftp sites for some time now.

For a machine with sufficient horsepower and some audio capability,
it is possible to emulate the amiga audio hardware in real time,
and play those modules.
After that, you're only limited by the machine's capabilities. The
sparc is a bit poor (8Khz sampling), in contrast with the indigo,
which gives an almost perfect rendition of most modules.

This release of tracker supports most amiga soundtracker file formats,
and plays most of the existing effects, so that about 99% of the modules
are output correctly.

There is no man page (write it yourself), but a short description of
the options can be obtained by running tracker without arguments.

Here is some supplementary information.

Environment variables:
OVERSAMPLE can be used to control the accuracy of the reproduction.
(The number of samples used to output one audio word).
The higher, the better, but the more CPU it will use. The default
value (1) is quite good at high frequencies, but not so for, for instance
a poor sparc station's 8000 Hz. You can try, say, 2 or 3. After that,
there won't be any noticeable improvement, and anyway, the program won't
be fast enough to keep up with the output rate. Note that the program is
special-cased for the default value (1), which should be significantly faster
on some architectures.

FREQUENCY can be used to set the audio output at a specific frequency
(if the hardware supports it). The hardware will decide which frequency
to actually use, according to other external parameters.

MONO can be used to force mono output, which uses less
cpu power.

TRANSPOSE is the number of halftones to transpose each note (>0 is higher).
Useful for low frequency sparcs which can't play some tunes accurately, or
when you get bored...

MODPATH can be set to be a path where you wish to look for mod files. This
is a sh-styled path: setenv MODPATH dir1:dir2:...

Command line switches:
-stereo/-mono: 
	switch between stereo/mono output
-mix <percent>: 
	for stereo output, decide how to mix left/right channels.
	0 is spatial stereo, 100 is mono. The change tends to
	be exponential, so you may want to experiment with values 
	around 90+.
-frequency <freq>:
	ask for a given output frequency. The normal output frequency
	is a `normal' frequency for your machine. <freq> will be rounded
	to a near available value.
-oversample <n>:
	where n is usually 1, 2 or 3. Try to use 1,2 or 3 sample values
	to accurately render a given sample. Changing the frequency 
	usually works better, but there might be cases where 2 or 3 gives
	you a better rendering for a given module. Big cpu-eater.
-new/old/both:
	select a soundtracker format, between new (31 instr), old (15 instr)
	and both (auto-detect what's going on). You should only use it if
	tracker gets very confused on a module.
-picky:
	do not allow for any problems in a module.
-tolerant:
	allow for many problems that would normally stop a module
-repeats / -repeats <n>:
	repeat each module n times. With no value (or a 0), repeat the
	module forever.
-verbose:
	show a sample listing for the module.
-show:
	scroll-display the module being played.
-sync:
	try to synchronize that scroll display with what you hear.
	Needs much cpu power to work correcty.
-speed <n>:
	change the base tempo to n. The normal value is 50 (PAL video
	frequency). Some modules have been written on a buggy NTSC composer,
	so you may wish to use -speed 60. Weird values like -speed 10 or
	-speed 2000 are allowable. 
	Note that the samples may sound a bit strange since you only change
	the tempo there.
-transpose <k>:
	transpose the song up k half-notes. Doesn't work all the time.
	Doesn't work right most of the time. For fun only. If k is
	negative, it obviously transposes the song down.
-start n:
	start the module at pattern number n instead of number 0

		Sample control:
		--------------
-cut all:
	suppress all samples from the audio output.
-add all
	add all samples to the audio output
-cut n:
	cut sample number n from the audio output.
-add n:
	add sample number n to the audio output.


Runtime control:
	n: go to next song
	r: restart current song
	p: go to previous song
	>: fast forward
	<: rewind
	S: NTSC tempo (60)
	s: PAL tempo (50)
	q
	x
	e: quit right away
	<space>: pause
