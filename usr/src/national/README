This package gives the Linux ability to load font, there are two keybords 
defined in kernel (which is pretty important for latin2), the first one, US, 
is hardcoded and the second can be changed with ioctl. They are altered with
scroll_lock. 

Included fonts:
	ISO 8859 Latin 1,2 8x8, 8x10, 8x12, 8x14, 8x16 pixels 
			with DEC graphic character set extension
	Hebrew and Russian font from "codepage"
	KOI8 ?? from "fontpak" 
(I would like to know which KOI8 it is, KOI8 is different name for ISO 8859
so maybe it's any latin-x)

All are converted to *.psf format, which is used in latin1 package, where
is also dos editor. Can be converted to/from ascii with [dump|make]font 
commands. 			 
  
Commands:

loadfont [-d dir] font_file page - to load font, where page has a little bit
	different meaning than in "codepage" resp. "fontpak"
	page 0 is the same, i.e. no user font, standard translation 
	page 1 - user font, latin-1,2, DEC graphics, PC graphics modes
	page 2 - user font, no translations			
	it's compiled with fontpath (defined in "config.h"), where is looks for
	font_file, for different directory -d flag must be used

setfont page - this is a script, which send ESC-F-U-page sequence to set page

makefont infile outfile - converts char set in ascii to psf format
dumpfont infile outfile - psf format -> ascii 

font - shows character set 

setkbd [-d dir] keymap_file diacr_file diacr_mask - sets new keyboard
	keymap_file includes keymap description, is consisted from
	five columns: scan_code key shift alt lock_state
	lock_state can be C or O and handles caps_lock, this is new
	to kernel, but it must be or latin-2 keyboards don't work properly
	possible formats for other columns are 'c', decimal, hexa and octal
	diacr_file includes dead keys and accents
	diacr_mask - decimal number, sum of 2^(i-1) if you want the i-th dead 
		     key 
	-d dir - same like loadfont 

Installation:

	cd ...../linux; patch -p0 <..../national/nat.patch to apply patch
	then recompile kernel
	look at the "config.h" and change paths you like
	type "make" to compile commands and "make install" to put them to
								/usr/bin
	put all/any fonts and keyboards to directories in config.h
	reboot

btw. scroll_lock led's on -> US kbd, off -> free
