This is the README file for the Taylor UUCP contrib directory.

This directory contains contributed shell scripts and programs that
you may find useful.

xchat.c:
    A program by Bob Denny that may be invoked by the ``chat-program''
    command for any of the various types of chat scripts.  It is
    driven by scripts which are written in its own little language.
    It is a powerful program that can add a lot of flexibility to your
    chat scripts, but it's not completely portable yet.

xchat.man:
    Manual page for xchat.

Dial.Hayes, Login.LAT, Login.VMS
    Sample chat scripts for use with xchat.

uurate.c:
    A nifty little program by Bob Denny which analyzes the Log and
    Stats file and prints various sorts of reports.  When you compile
    it, say something like ``cc -I.. -o uurate uurate.c'' since it
    includes header files that are part of the main UUCP distribution.

uurate.man:
    Manual page for uurate.

savelog.sh:
    A handy shell script to rename a log file and cycle old versions
    through a set of names, throwing away the oldest one.  It will
    also optionally compress the old log files.  I believe that this
    is originally from smail.  It was written by Ronald S. Karr and
    Landon Curt Noll, and was given to me by Bob Denny.

savelog.man:
    Manual page for savelog.sh.

stats.sh:
    A gawk script by Zacharias Beckman which reads the Stats file and
    prints the last 80 lines as a nicely formatted table.

uuq.sh:
    A uuq workalike shell script by Zacharias Beckman.

tstout.c:
    A program to remove a user from utmp and wtmp, essentially logging
    them out.  I put this together from BSD code.  I need it to use
    tstuu with the system UUCP on Ultrix 4.0, for reasons that escape
    me.  Most people will have little use for this.
