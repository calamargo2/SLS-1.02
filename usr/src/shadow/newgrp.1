.TH NEWGRP 1
.SH NAME
newgrp \- Change group ID
.br
sg \- Execute command as different group ID
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B newgrp
[ - ] [ \fIgroup\fR ]
.br
.B sg
[ - ] [ \fIgroup\fR [ \fB-c\fR \fIcommand\fR ] ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I newgrp
is used to change the current group ID during a login session.
If the optional \fB\-\fR flag is given, the user's environment
will be reinitialized as though the user had logged in, otherwise
the current environment, including current working directory,
remains unchanged.
.PP
.I newgrp
changes the current real group ID to the named group, or to
the default group listed in \fB/etc/passwd\fR if no group name
is given.
The user will be prompted for a password if they do not have a
password and the group does, or if the user is not listed as a
member and the group has a password.
The user will be denied access if the group password is empty
and the user is not listed as a member.
.PP
The
.I sg
command works similiar to \fInewgrp\fR but does not replace the
user's shell, so upon exit from a \fIsg\fR command, you are
returned to your previous group ID.
.I sg
also accepts a command.
The command will be executed with the Bourne shell and must be
enclosed in quotes.
.SH CAVEATS
.PP
This version of \fInewgrp\fR has many compilation options,
only some of which may be in use at any particular site.
