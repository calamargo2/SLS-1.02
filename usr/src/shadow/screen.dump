Hi John.
 
I am the administrator of the SLS release of the free 386 unix
distribution using Linux.  I just finished porting your shadow
password stuff to LInux, and must admit, I am impressed.  In
the process, I even found a couple of bugs, probably because I
insisted upon using the shadow groups stuff as well.   You probably
already have this, but just in case, note that shadow.c and gshadow.c
were just the forgetting to check for NULL string in cp after reading
reading the fields.   Also, groups() was being called in newgrp.c
with just one argument.  The other changes, may be just specific to
Linux.  You will have to be the judge.
