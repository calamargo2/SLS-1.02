 * chpasswd - update passwords in batch
 *
 *	chpasswd reads standard input for a list of colon separated
 *	user names and new passwords.  the appropriate password
 *	files are updated to reflect the changes.  because the
 *	changes are made in a batch fashion, the user must run
 *	the mkpasswd command after this command terminates since
 *	no password updates occur until the very end.
