.TH FAILLOG 8
.SH NAME
faillog \- examine faillog and set login failure limits
.SH SYNOPSIS
/etc/faillog [ -u uid ] [ -a ] [ -t days ] [ -m max ] [ -pr ] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIfaillog\fR formats the contents of the failure log,
\fI/usr/adm/faillog\fR, and maintains failure counts and
limits.
The order of the arguments to \fIfaillog\fR is significant.
Each argument is processed immediately in the order given.
.PP
The \fB-p\fR flag causes failure entries to be printed in UID
order.
Entering \fB-u login-name\fR flag will
cause the failure record for \fBlogin-name\fR only to be printed.
Entering \fB-t days\fR will cause only the
failures more recent than \fBdays\fR to be printed.
The \fB-t\fR flag overrides the use of \fB-u\fR.
The \fB-a\fR flag causes all users to be selected.
When used with the \fB-p\fR flag, this option selects all users
who have ever had a login failure.
It is meaningless with the \fB-r\fR flag.
.PP
The \fB-r\fR flag is used to reset the count of login failures.
Write access to \fI/usr/adm/faillog\fR is required for
this option.
Entering \fB-u login-name\fR will cause only the failure count
for \fBlogin-name\fR to be reset.
.PP
The \fB-m\fR flag is used to set the maximum number of login
failures before the account is disabled.
Write access to \fB/usr/adm/faillog\fR is required for this
option.
Entering \fB-m max\fR will cause all accounts to be disabled
after \fBmax\fR failed logins occur.
This may be modified with \fB-u login-name\fR to limit this
function to \fBlogin-name\fR only.
Selecting a \fBmax\fR value of 0 has the effect of not placing
a limit on the number of failed logins.
The maximum failure count
should always be 0 for \fBroot\fR to prevent
a denial of services attack against the system.
.PP
Options may be combined in virtually any fashion.
Each \fB-p\fR, \fB-r\fR, and \fB-m\fR option will cause
immediate execution using any \fB-u\fR or \fB-t\fR modifier.
.SH Bugs
\fIfaillog\fR only prints out users with no successful login since
the last failure.
To print out a user who has had a successful login since their last
failure, you must explicitly request the user with the \fB-u\fR flag,
or print out all users with the \fB-a\fR flag.
