The password field may not be filled if shadow passwords
have been enabled.
If shadow passwords are being used, the encrypted password will
be found in \fB/etc/shadow\fR.
The encryped password consists of 13 characters from the
64 character alphabet
a thru z, A thru Z, 0 thru 9, \. and /.
Refer to \fIcrypt(3)\fR for details on how this string is
interpreted.
.PP
An optional password age string may follow the encrypted
password, separated by a comma, from the same alphabet
as the password itself.
The first character gives the number of weeks during which the
password is valid.
The second character gives the number of weeks which must pass
before the user is permitted to change the password.
The last two characters give the week since Jan 1970 when the
password was last changed.
When the number of weeks during which the password is valid
have passed, the user will be required to provide a new
password.
.PP
The comment field is used by various system utilities, such as
\fIfinger(1)\fR.
