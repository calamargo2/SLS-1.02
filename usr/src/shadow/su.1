.SH NAME
su \- Change user ID or become super-user
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B su
[ - ] [ username [ args ] ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I su
is used to become another user during a login session.
Invoked without a username, \fIsu\fR defaults to becoming
the super user.
The optional argument \fB\-\fR may be used to provide an
environment similiar to what the user would expect had
the user logged in directly.
.PP
Additional arguments may be provided after the username,
in which case they are supplied to the user\'s login shell.
In particular, an argument of \fB-c\fR will cause the
next argument to be treated as a command by most command
interpreters.
The command will be executed under the shell specified by
\fB$SHELL\fR, or if undefined, by the one specified in
\fI/etc/passwd\fR.
.PP
The user will be prompted for a password, if appropriate.
Invalid passwords will produce an error message.
All attempts, both valid and invalid, are logged to detect
abuses of the system.
.PP
The current environment is passed to the new shell.
The value of \fB$PATH\fR is reset to \fB/bin:/usr/bin\fR
for normal users, or \fB/bin:/usr/bin:/etc\fR for the super user.
.SH CAVEATS
