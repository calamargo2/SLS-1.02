This is beta release 1.2.2 of GNU Oleo.  This release fixes various
configuration problems, portability problems, and bugs in the
oleo-1.2.1 release.

Oleo is a spreadsheet program (better for you than the more expensive
spreadsheet).  It supports X windows and character-based terminals, and
can generate embedded PostScript(*) renditions of spreadsheets.
Keybindings should be familiar to Emacs users and are configurable by
users.

There is relatively little documentation for Oleo.  The file USING
contains what there is.

Future plans include:
  - Improving the Oleo command set and display interface.

  - Making Oleo use the GNU graphics to produce graphs from spreadsheet
    data.

  - Extending the data model to support
    - Multiple spreadsheet files (like multiple buffers in Emacs).
    - Multiple named variables and arrays within a single file
      (or shared by multiple files).
    - Symbolic addressing (rather than only row/column addressing).

n.b. The MS-DOS support in the Oleo alpha has not been respected.
  Oleo no longer compiles as-is on MS-DOS.
