ABOUT InstallTutorial
========================================

The InstallTutorial script here is meant to be run by each user before
running through the SUIT tutorial. Because each site is different, you
may need to tweak this file a bit. Typical things that need changing
are locations of the SUIT files (SUIT) and the name of the tutorial
directory (TUTORIAL).

Once this script is ready, it should be placed in a directory where it can
be run by anyone.

The important thing that this script does:
	1.) Creates a "tutorial" directory for the user

	2.) Copies the necessary files into the tutorial directory
		tutorial/empty.c
		tutorial/Makefile
		tutorial/demo.sui
		tutorial/poly.sui
		tutorial/3cell.sui
		
	3.) Makes links to the proper binaries
		bin/demo
		bin/3cell
		bin/poly

	4.) Does simple error checking to make sure everything went
		OK. The error checking in this script is pretty weak
		but was sufficient for our purposes.

When this is all done, the user should have a directory that contains:
	FILES
	----------
	empty.c
	Makefile
	demo.sui
	poly.sui
	3cell.sui
	
	LINKS
	---------
	demo
	3cell
	poly
