INSTALLING SUIT: A Guide to SUIT's makefiles
===============================================

Here are a few steps to follow for a happy SUIT installation.
Do these steps before attempting to make a program with SUIT.


1.) Modify the Makefiles for your site
	This is easy, because it's all automated for you.

	We supply several different Makefiles and installation scripts
	in the SUIT distribution and there are lines in these files
	that will need to be changed so that they work at your
	location. 

	To update the files, you will be changing a few lines in that
	master Makefile that lives in the same directory as the README
	file you're looking at now. Use a text editor to modify the
	following lines of the file called "Makefile".

	========================================
	SUIT= /usr/src/suit
	========================================
	This will DEFINITELY change. This is the name of the directory
	where the SUIT distribution will live. (Typically this is the name of
	the directory that contains the README file you are looking at
	right now.) 
	For example, if you just uncompressed suit.tpz in 
	the directory called 
		/home/fred/suit
	you will change this line to read 
		SUIT=/home/fred/suit

	========================================
	XLIB	 = 
	========================================
	This is the place where you can find the file called libX11.a
	(the X library file). 
	
	
	========================================
	X_INC_DIR = /usr/X386/include/X11
	========================================
	This is the place where you can find the file called X.h 
	(the X header file). 
	


2.) Install SUIT
	Once these lines are correct, you can type 
	
	make install
	
	WHAT THIS DOES: 
	1.) This will modify all the Makefiles and installation
	    scripts in the SUIT distribution to work at your site. 
	    If you ever move the SUIT libraries or include files, 
	    you will need to change the lines in this Makefile and run
	    "make install" again (or change the Makefiles and installation
	    scripts yourself).

	2.) This will install the shared libraries in the correct place
	    (The libraries will be installed in /lib and the stub files will
	    be placed in /usr/lib).
	
	3.) This will build the programs that you will need to run the 
	    SUIT tutorial: demo, 3cell, and poly.	

3.) IMPORTANT: Go through the SUIT tutorial.

	One of SUIT's greatest strengths is its tutorial.
	We *STRONGLY* urge you to print out the tutorial
	postscript file and run through it.

	   		  AN IMPORTANT NOTE ON PRINTING THE DOCS
			==========================================
	**************************************************************************
	The SUIT docs are in ps files that print
	BACK TO FRONT. To avoid the annoyance of having to re-order the pages,
	open the back door of your printer before you print the tutorial or 
	reference manual. Opening this back door provides a straight
	paper path.Opening this door will also let the pages stack
	correctly as they print.
	
	If you require documentation that prints FRONT TO BACK
		OR
	If your printer runs out of memory

		you can ftp the docs from us in separate ps files --
		see the directory called

			pub/distribution/JustDocs
	**************************************************************************

	
	To print:
	--------
	Start in the top level suit directory.

	Type:
		cd doc
		lpr Tutorial.ps

	To use the tutorial, you will need to have 
	installed SUIT with the "make install" 
	procedure described above.

	SUIT comes with a script called 
		install_tutorial

	which will make a directory containing all the files
	necessary for running the tutorial. 
	
	Run this script in your HOME DIRECTORY, and
	run through the tutorial.

	example:
		cd $HOME
		$HOME/suit/tutorial/install_tutorial

	
NOTE: 
SUIT comes with the libraries already built. If you 
    ever need to rebuild the SUIT libraries, 
    In the top level directory, Type:
	cd src
	make
