                             WHAT IS DELIVER?


Deliver is a program which delivers electronic mail once it has arrived
at a given machine.



                              WHO CAN USE IT?


Deliver is intended for use in three environments:


    1.  Any Xenix system.

        Deliver was invented to be a direct replacement for the Xenix
        program /usr/lib/mail/mail.local.  In fact, on tct, mail.local is
	just another link to /usr/bin/deliver.


    2.  Any Unix system with smail 2.x.

        You can use deliver for local mail by changing the local mailer
        definition in config.h:
	    #define LMAIL(frm)      "/usr/bin/deliver -r '%s'",frm


    3.  Any Unix system with either sendmail or smail 3.x.

	Any user can let deliver handle all his mail by putting the
	following line in his .forward file:
	    "|/usr/bin/deliver username"
	Be sure to specify the correct username, or someone else will
	get your mail!



                                PORTABILITY


Deliver has been compiled and tested under SCO Xenix System V/286 and 4.3
BSD.  The configuration provides for System V, but I have not been able to
test it. (Patches for all environments are welcome; see below.)



			   WARNINGS: BE CAREFUL!


    1.  Deliver is intended to be run setuid root; otherwise it would not
        be possible to execute a user delivery file in the context of its
        owner.  Any setuid root program is a potential security hole!  Be
        careful of the modes on the deliver binary and the directory where
        it lives.

    2.  Deliver's flexibility makes it easy to lose lots of mail through
	carelessness in configuration.  Delivery files should be written
	with extreme care.



                          COMPILING AND INSTALLING


Edit the Makefile and config.h to taste.  Type "make".  To install, type
"make install".  See the Makefile for further hints.
