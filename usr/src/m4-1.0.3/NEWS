`dnl' should be followed by newline or whitespace.

one argument.  This is useful for introducing long comments.

* M4OPTS environment variable is no longer obeyed.

* `--no-warnings' option is renamed `--silent'.

* Debug lines use a new format more compatible with GNU standards.

* Various bugs have been corrected.  See the ChangeLog for details.

is defined.
