This is the file README for the GNU m4 distribution, version 1.0.3.

	This is a beta release.  You might want to delay installation
	until GNU m4 1.1, letting problems be ironed out first.  Cray
	is not supported yet, waiting for the Cray version of alloca
	to settle down, this might happen soon.  (Sorry, Hal!)

See file INSTALL for installation instructions.  GNU m4 now uses an
Autoconf-generated configure script.  Please report any error coming
out of `make check', since there should be none.

In the subdirectory `examples' you will find various m4 files, ranging
from trivial test files to rather advanced macros.  If you intend to
use m4 seriously, you might find useful material down there.

Send bug reports to <bug-gnu-utils@prep.ai.mit.edu>.  Bug reports
should ideally include:

	* The version number of m4
	* The hardware and operating system
	* The compiler used to compile
	* The config.status file produced by configure
	* A description of the bug behaviour
	* The input to m4, that triggered the bug
	* A transcript of the output from m4
	* The output you were really expecting

If I can't reproduce the bug, there is really not much I can do about
it.

Many thanks to those, who provided me with bug reports and feedback.
See the files THANKS and ChangeLog for more details.
