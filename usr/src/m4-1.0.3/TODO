These are more or less in decreasing order of priority.

* Check for <stdarg.h>, use it instead of <varargs.h>.
* m4.c: cmd_error() used before arguments declared, predeclared ().
* m4.c: internal_error() used before being declared.

* Revise `genuine bug' corrections suggested by Thorsten.

* Carefully revise overall const usage.

* Avoid diagnostics related to volatile functions.

* Clean up some of the obstack.[ch] code.

* Have NULs go really undisturbed through GNU m4.
