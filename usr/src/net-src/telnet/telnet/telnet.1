.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm telnet
command
is used to communicate with another host using the 
.Li TELNET
protocol.
If
.Nm telnet
is invoked without the
.Ar host
argument, it enters command mode,
indicated by its prompt
.Pq Nm telnet\&> .
In this mode, it accepts and executes the commands listed below.
If it is invoked with arguments, it performs an
.Ic open
command with those arguments.
.Pp
Options:
.Tw Fl
.Tp Fl 8
Use an eight bit data path.  This will cause
an attempt to negotiate the BINARY option on both
input and output.
.Tp Fl E
The
.Fl E
option stops any character from being recognized as an escape character.
.Tp Fl K
Do not attempt to do automatic login to the
remote system.
.Tp Fl L
Use an eight bit data path on output.
This causes the BINARY option to be negotiated
on output.
.Tp Cx Fl X
.Cx \&\ \&
.Ar atype
.Cx
Disable the
.Ar atype
type of authentication.
.Tp Fl a
Attempt automatic login.
Currently, this sends the user name via the USER variable
of the ENVIRON option if supported by the remote system.
The name used is that of the current user as returned by
.Xr getlogin 2
if it agrees with the current user ID,
otherwise it is the name associated with the user ID.
.Tp Fl c
The
.Fl c
flag disables the reading of the users 
.Pa \&.telnetrc.
(See the
.Ic toggle
.Ic skiprc
command below.)
.Tp Fl d
Sets the initial value of the
.Ic debug
toggle to
.Li TRUE
.Tp Cx Fl e
.Cx \&\ \&
.Ar escape char
.Cx
Sets the initial
.Nm
.B telnet
escape character to
.Ar escape char.
If
.Ar escape char
is ommitted, then
there will be no escape character.
.Tp Cx Fl k
.Cx \&\ \&
.Ar realm
.Cx
If Kerberos authentication is being used, the
.Fl k
option requests that
.Nm telnet
obtain tickets for the remote host in realm
.Ar realm
instead of the remote host's
realm as determined by
.Xr krb_realmofhost 3  .
.Tp Cx Fl l
.Cx \&\ \&
.Ar user
.Cx
When connecting to the remote system, if the remote system
understands the ENVIRON option, then
.Ar user
will be sent to the remote system as the value for the variable USER.
This option implies the
.Fl a
option.
This option may also be used with the
.Ic open
command.
.Tp Cx Fl n
.Cx \&\ \&
.Ar tracefile
.Cx
Opens
.Ar tracefile
for recording trace information.
See the
.Ic set tracefile
command below.
.Tp Fl r
Use a user interface similar to
.Xr rlogin 1  .
In this mode, the escape character is set to the tilde (``~'')
character, unless modified by the
.Fl e
flag.
.Tp Fl x
Turn on encryption of the data stream, if possible.
.Tp Ar host
Indicates the official name, an alias, or the Internet address
of a remote host.
.Tp Ar port
Indicates a port number (address of an application) or name.  If a number is
not specified, the default
.Nm telnet
port is used.
Port names are mapped to port numbers via the
/etc/services
file.
Normally when a port number is specified,
.Nm telnet
will not send out any initial
.Li TELNET
option negotiation.
If the port number/name is preceded by
a minus sign, then
the initial
.Li TELNET
option negotiation will be sent.
.Tp
.Pp
When in
.Nm rlogin
mode, a line of the form ``~.'' disconnects from the remote host,
where ``~'' is the
.Nm
escape character.
Similarly, the line ``~^Z'' will suspend the
.Nm telnet
session.
The line ``~^]'' will escape to the normal
.Nm telnet
escape prompt.
.Pp
Once a connection has been opened,
.Nm telnet
will attempt to enable the
.Li TELNET LINEMODE
option.
If this fails, then
.Nm telnet
will revert to one of two input modes:
either \*(Lqcharacter at a time\*(Rq
or \*(Lqold line by line\*(Rq
depending on what the remote system supports.
.Pp
When 
.Li LINEMODE
is enabled, character processing is done on the
local system, under the control of the remote system.  When input
editing or character echoing is to be disabled, the remote system
will relay that information.  The remote system will also relay
changes to any special characters that happen on the remote
system, so that they can take effect on the local system.
.Pp
In \*(Lqcharacter at a time\*(Rq mode, most
text typed is immediately sent to the remote host for processing.
.Pp
In \*(Lqold line by line\*(Rq mode, all text is echoed locally,
and (normally) only completed lines are sent to the remote host.
The \*(Lqlocal echo character\*(Rq (initially \*(Lq^E\*(Rq) may be used
to turn off and on the local echo
(this would mostly be used to enter passwords
without the password being echoed).
.Pp
If the 
.Li LINEMODE
option is enabled, or if the
.Ic localchars
toggle is TRUE (the default for \*(Lqold line by line\*(Lq; see below),
the user's
.Ic quit  ,
.Ic intr ,
and
.Ic flush
characters are trapped locally, and sent as
.Li TELNET
protocol sequences to the remote side.
If 
.Li LINEMODE
has ever been enabled, then the user's
.Ic susp
and
.Ic eof
are also sent as
.Li TELNET
protocol sequences,
and
.Ic quit
is sent as a 
.Li TELNET ABORT
instead of 
.Li BREAK
There are options (see
.Ic toggle
.Ic autoflush
and
.Ic toggle
.Ic autosynch
below)
which cause this action to flush subsequent output to the terminal
(until the remote host acknowledges the
.Li TELNET
sequence) and flush previous terminal input
(in the case of
.Ic quit
and
.Ic intr  ) .
.Pp
While connected to a remote host,
.Nm telnet
command mode may be entered by typing the
.Nm telnet
\*(Lqescape character\*(Rq (initially \*(Lq^
\*(Rq).
When in command mode, the normal terminal editing conventions are available.
.Pp
The following
.Nm telnet
commands are available.
Only enough of each command to uniquely identify it need be typed
(this is also true for most of the arguments to the
commands).
.Pp

.Tp
.\" ######## END the "environ" command
.\"
.\" ######## BEGIN the "logout" command
.Tp Ic logout
Send the
.Li TELNET LOGOUT
option to the remote side.
This is similar to doing a
.Ic close
command, however
if the remote side does not support the
.Li LOGOUT
option, then nothing will happen.
If, however, the remote side does support the
.Li LOGOUT
option, then this command should cause the remote side
to close the
.Li TELNET
connection.
In addition, if the remote side supports the concept of suspending
a users session for later re-attachement, the
.Li LOGOUT
option indicates that the session should be terminated immediately.
.\" ######## END the "logout" command
.\"
.\" ######## BEGIN the "mode" command
.Tp Cx Ic mode
.Cx \&\ \&
.Ar type
.Cx
.Ar Type
is one of several options, depending on the state of the
.Li TELNET
session.
The remote host is asked for permission to go into the requested mode.
If the remote host is capable of entering that mode, the requested
mode will be entered.
.Tw Ar
.Tp Ic character

option.
This requires that the 
.Li LINEMODE
option be enabled.
.Tp Cx Ic edit
.Cx \&\ \&
.Pq Ic \-edit
.Cx
Attempt to enable (disable) the 
.Li EDIT
mode of the 
.Li LINEMODE
option.
This requires that the 
.Li LINEMODE
option be enabled.
.Tp Cx Ic softtabs
.Cx \&\ \&
.Pq Ic \-softtabs
.Cx
Attempt to enable (disable) the 
.Li SOFT_TAB
mode of the 
.Li LINEMODE
option.
This requires that the 
.Li LINEMODE
option be enabled.
.Tp Cx Ic litecho
.Cx \&\ \&
.Pq Ic \-litecho
.Cx
Attempt to enable (disable) the 
.Li LIT_ECHO
mode of the 
.Li LINEMODE
option.
This requires that the 
.Li LINEMODE
option be enabled.
.Tp Ic \&?
Prints out help information for the
.Ic mode
command.

.Cx [
.Op Fl l
.Cx \&\ \&
.Ar user
.Cx ]
.Cx [
.Op Fl
.Cx \&\ \&
.Ar port
.Cx ]
.Cx
Open a connection to the named host.
If no port number
is specified,
.Nm telnet
will attempt to contact a
.Li TELNET
server at the default port.
The host specification may be either a host name (see
.Xr hosts 5  )
or an Internet address specified in the \*(Lqdot notation\*(Rq (see
.Xr inet 3  ) .
The
.Op Fl l
option may be used to specify the user name
to be passed to the remote system via the
.Li ENVIRON
option.
When connecting to a non-standard port,
.Nm telnet
omits any automatic initiation of
.Li TELNET
options.  When the port number is preceded by a minus sign,
the initial option negotiation is done.
After establishing a connection,
if the
.Ic skiprc
variable is not enabled
(see the
.Ic toggle
.Ic skiprc
command below),
the file
.Pa \&.telnetrc
in the
users home directory is opened.  Lines beginning with a # are
comment lines.  Blank lines are ignored.  Lines that begin
without whitespace are the start of a machine entry.  The
first thing on the line is the name of the machine that is
being connected to.  The rest of the line, and successive
lines that begin with whitespace are assumed to be
.Nm telnet
commands and are processed as if they had been typed
in manually to the
.Nm telnet
command prompt.
The special machine name
.Ic DEFAULT
is used to specify commands that should be executed for
all machines.
There may be more than one entry for a machine; all matches
will the specified machine name will be executed.
.\" ######## END the "open" command
.\"
.\" ######## BEGIN the "quit" command
.Tp Ic quit
Close any open
.Li TELNET
session and exit
.Nm telnet  .
An end of file (in command mode) will also close a session and exit.
.\" ######## END the "quit" command
.\"
.\" ######## BEGIN the "send" command
.Tp Cx Ic send
.Cx \&\ \&
.Ar arguments
.Cx
Sends one or more special character sequences to the remote host.
The following are the arguments which may be specified
(more than one argument may be specified at a time):
.Pp
.Tw Ds
.Tp Ic abort
Sends the
.Li TELNET ABORT
(ABORT processes)
sequence.
.Tp Ic ao
Sends the
.Li TELNET AO
(Abort Output) sequence, which should cause the remote system to flush
all output
.Em from
the remote system
.Em to
the user's terminal.
.Tp Ic ayt
Sends the
.Li TELNET AYT
(Are You There)
sequence, to which the remote system may or may not choose to respond.
.Tp Ic brk
Sends the
.Li TELNET BRK
(Break) sequence, which may have significance to the remote
system.
.Tp Ic ec
Sends the
.Li TELNET EC
(Erase Character)
sequence, which should cause the remote system to erase the last character
entered.
.Tp Ic el
Sends the
.Li TELNET EL
(Erase Line)
sequence, which should cause the remote system to erase the line currently
being entered.
.Tp Ic eof
Sends the
.Li TELNET EOF
(End Of File)
sequence.
.Tp Ic eor
Sends the
.Li TELNET EOR
(End of Record)
sequence.
.Tp Ic escape
Sends the current
.Nm telnet
escape character (initially \*(Lq^\*(Rq).
.Tp Ic ga
Sends the
.Li TELNET GA
(Go Ahead)
sequence, which likely has no significance to the remote system.
.Tp Ic getstatus
If the remote side supports the
.Li TELNET STATUS
command,
.Ic getstatus
will send the subnegotiation to request that the server send
its current option status.
.Tp Ic ip
Sends the
.Li TELNET IP
(Interrupt Process) sequence, which should cause the remote
system to abort the currently running process.
.Tp Ic nop
Sends the
.Li TELNET NOP
(No OPeration)
sequence.
.Tp Ic susp
Sends the
.Li TELNET SUSP
(SUSPend process)
sequence.
.Tp Ic synch
Sends the
.Li TELNET SYNCH
sequence.
This sequence causes the remote system to discard all previously typed
(but not yet read) input.
This sequence is sent as TCP urgent
data (and may not work if the remote system is a 4.2 BSD system -- if
it doesn't work, a lower case \*(Lqr\*(Rq may be echoed on the terminal).
.Tp Ic \&?
Prints out help information for the
.Ic send
command.
.Tp
.\" ######## END the "send" command

.Cx
.Tp Cx Ic unset
.Cx \&\ \&
.Ar argument value
.Cx
The
.Ic set
command will set any one of a number of
.Nm telnet
variables to a specific value or to TRUE.
The special value
.Ic off
turns off the function associated with
the variable, this is equivalent to using the
.Ic unset
command.
The
.Ic unset
command will disable or set to FALSE any of the specified functions.
The values of variables may be interrogated with the
.Ic display
command.
The variables which may be set or unset, but not toggled, are
listed here.  In addition, any of the variables for the
.Ic toggle
command may be explicitly set or unset using
the
.Ic set
and
.Ic unset
commands.
.Tw Fl
.Tp Ic ayt

above)
is sent to the remote host.
The initial value for the ayt character is taken to be
the terminal's
.Ic status
character.
.Tp Ic echo
This is the value (initially \*(Lq^E\*(Rq) which, when in
\*(Lqline by line\*(Rq mode, toggles between doing local echoing
of entered characters (for normal processing), and suppressing
echoing of entered characters (for entering, say, a password).
.Tp Ic eof
If
.Nm telnet

is operating in \*(Lqcharacter at a time\*(Rq mode, then when this
character is typed, a
.Li TELNET EC
sequence (see
.Ic send
.Ic ec
above)
is sent to the remote system.
The initial value for the erase character is taken to be
the terminal's
.Ic erase
character.
.Tp Ic escape
This is the
.Nm telnet
escape character (initially \*(Lq^[\*(Rq) which causes entry
into
.Nm telnet
command mode (when connected to a remote system).
.Tp Ic flushoutput
If
.Nm telnet
is in
.Ic localchars
mode (see
.Ic toggle
.Ic localchars
below)
and the
.Ic flushoutput
character is typed, a
.Li TELNET AO
sequence (see
.Ic send
.Ic ao
above)
is sent to the remote host.
The initial value for the flush character is taken to be
the terminal's
.Ic flush
character.
.Tp Ic forw1
.Tp Ic forw2
If
.Nm telnet
is operating in
.Li LINEMODE,
these are the characters that, when typed,
cause partial lines to be forwarded to the remote system.
The initial value for the forw1 and forw2 characters are
taken from the terminal's
.Ic eol
and
.Ic eol2
characters.
.Tp Ic interrupt
If
.Nm telnet
is in
.Ic localchars
mode (see
.Ic toggle
.Ic localchars
below)
and the
.Ic interrupt
character is typed, a
.Li TELNET IP
sequence (see
.Ic send
.Ic ip
above)
is sent to the remote host.
The initial value for the interrupt character is taken to be
the terminal's
.Ic intr
character.
.Tp Ic kill
If

the terminal's
.Ic kill
character.
.Tp Ic lnext
If
.Nm telnet
is operating in
.Li LINEMODE
or \*(Lqold line by line\*(Lq mode, then this character is taken to

The initial value for the lnext character is taken to be
the terminal's
.Ic lnext
character.
.Tp Ic quit
If
.Nm telnet
is in
.Ic localchars
mode (see
.Ic toggle
.Ic localchars
below)
and the

.Ic brk
above)
is sent to the remote host.
The initial value for the quit character is taken to be
the terminal's
.Ic quit
character.
.Tp Ic reprint
If
.Nm telnet
is operating in
.Li LINEMODE
or \*(Lqold line by line\*(Lq mode, then this character is taken to
be the terminal's
.Ic reprint
character.
The initial value for the reprint character is taken to be
the terminal's
.Ic reprint
character.
.Tp Ic rlogin
This is the rlogin escape character.
If set, the normal
.Nm telnet
.Ic escape
character will be ignored unless it is preceded by this character
at the beginning of a line.
This character, at the beginning of a line, followed by a ``.''
will close the connection; when followed by a ``^Z'' it will
suspend the
.Nm telnet
command.
The initial state is to have the
.Ic rlogin
escape character disabled.
.Tp Ic start
If the
.Li TELNET TOGGLE-FLOW-CONTROL
option has been enabled,
then this character is taken to
be the terminal's
.Ic start

the terminal's
.Ic stop
character.
.Tp Ic susp
If
.Nm telnet
is in
.Ic localchars
mode, or

sequence (see
.Ic send
.Ic susp
above)
is sent to the remote host.
The initial value for the suspend character is taken to be
the terminal's
.Ic suspend
character.
.Tp Ic tracefile
This is the file to which the output, caused by
.Ic netdata,
.Ic termdata,
or
.Ic option
tracing being TRUE, will be written.  If it is set to
.Dq Fl ,
then tracing information will be written to standard output (the default).
.Tp Ic worderase
If
.Nm telnet

.Li LINEMODE
or \*(Lqold line by line\*(Lq mode, then this character is taken to
be the terminal's

character.
The initial value for the worderase character is taken to be
the terminal's

.Cx \&\ \&
.Ar state
.Cx
The
.Ic slc
command (Set Local Characters) is used to set
or change the state of the the special
characters when the 
.Li TELNET LINEMODE
option has
been enabled.  Special characters are characters that get
mapped to 
.Li TELNET
commands sequences (like
.Ic ip
or
.Ic quit  )
or line editing characters (like
.Ic erase
and
.Ic kill  ) .
By default, the local special characters are exported.
.Tw Fl
.Tp Ic export
Switch to the local defaults for the special characters.  The
local default characters are those of the local terminal at
the time when
.Nm telnet
was started.
.Tp Ic import
Switch to the remote defaults for the special characters.
The remote default characters are those of the remote system
at the time when the 
.Li TELNET
connection was established.
.Tp Ic check
Verify the current settings for the current special characters.
The remote side is requested to send all the current special
character settings, and if there are any discrepancies with
the local side, the local side will switch to the remote value.
.Tp Ic \&?
Prints out help information for the
.Ic slc
command.
.Tp
.\" ######## END the "slc" command

.\" ######## BEGIN the "toggle" command
.Tp Cx Ic toggle
.Cx \&\ \&
.Ar arguments ...
.Cx
Toggle (between
TRUE
and
FALSE)
various flags that control how
.Nm telnet
responds to events.
These flags may be set explicitly to TRUE or FALSE
using the
.Ic set
and
.Ic unset
commands listed above.
More than one argument may be specified.
The state of these flags may be interrogated with the
.Ic display
command.
Valid arguments are:
.Tw Ar
.Tp Ic authdebug
Turn on debugging information for the authentication code.
.Tp Ic autoflush
If
.Ic autoflush
and
.Ic localchars
are both
TRUE,
then when the
.Ic ao  ,
or
.Ic quit
characters are recognized (and transformed into
.Li TELNET
sequences; see
.Ic set
above for details),
.Nm telnet
refuses to display any data on the user's terminal
until the remote system acknowledges (via a
.Li TELNET TIMING MARK
option)
that it has processed those
.Li TELNET
sequences.
The initial value for this toggle is TRUE if the terminal user had not
done an "stty noflsh", otherwise FALSE (see
.Xr stty  1  ) .
.Tp Ic autoencrypt
.Tp Ic autodecrypt
When the
.Li TELNET ENCRYPTION
option is negotiated,
by default the actual encryption (decryption) of the data
stream does not automatically start.
The
.Ic autoencrypt
.Ic (autodecrypt)
command states that encryption of the output (input) stream should be
enabled as soon as possible.
.Tp Ic autologin
If the
.Li TELNET AUTHENTICATION
option is supported by the remote side, then
.Nm telnet
will attempt to use it to perform automatic authentication.
If the
.Li AUTHENTICATION
option is not supported, then the users login name will
be propagated via the
.Li TELNET ENVIRON
option.
This command is the same as specifying
.Fl a
option on the
.Ic open
command.
.Tp Ic autosynch
If
.Ic autosynch
and
.Ic localchars
are both
TRUE,
then when either the
.Ic intr
or
.Ic quit
characters is typed (see
.Ic set
above for descriptions of the
.Ic intr
and
.Ic quit
characters), the resulting
.Li TELNET
sequence sent is followed by the
.Li TELNET SYNCH
sequence.
This procedure
.Ic should
cause the remote system to begin throwing away all previously
typed input until both of the
.Li TELNET
sequences have been read and acted upon.
The initial value of this toggle is FALSE.
.Tp Ic binary
Enable or disable the
.Li TELNET BINARY
option on both input and output.
.Tp Ic inbinary
Enable or disable the
.Li TELNET BINARY
option on input.
.Tp Ic outbinary
Enable or disable the
.Li TELNET BINARY
option on output.
.Tp Ic crlf
If this is TRUE, then carriage returns will be sent as <CR><LF>.
If this is FALSE, then carriage returns will be send as <CR><NUL>.
The initial value for this toggle is FALSE.
.Tp Ic crmod
Toggle carriage return mode.
When this mode is enabled, most carriage return characters received from
the remote host will be mapped into a carriage return followed by
a line feed.
This mode does not affect those characters typed by the user, only
those received from the remote host.
This mode is not very useful unless the remote host
only sends carriage return, but never line feed.
The initial value for this toggle is FALSE.
.Tp Ic debug
Toggles socket level debugging (useful only to the
.Ic super user  ) .
The initial value for this toggle is FALSE.
.Tp Ic encdebug
Turn on debugging information for the encryption code.
.Tp Ic localchars
If this is
TRUE,
then the
.Ic flush  ,
.Ic interrupt ,
.Ic quit  ,
.Ic erase ,
and
.Ic kill
characters (see
.Ic set
above) are recognized locally, and transformed into (hopefully) appropriate
.Li TELNET
control sequences
(respectively
.Ic ao  ,
.Ic ip ,
.Ic brk  ,
.Ic ec ,
and
.Ic el  ;
see
.Ic send
above).
The initial value for this toggle is TRUE in \*(Lqold line by line\*(Rq mode,
and FALSE in \*(Lqcharacter at a time\*(Rq mode.
When the
.Li LINEMODE
option is enabled, the value of
.Ic localchars
is ignored, and assumed to always be TRUE.
If
.Li LINEMODE
has ever been enabled, then
.Ic quit
is sent as
.Ic abort  ,
and
.Ic eof and
.B suspend
are sent as
.Ic eof and
.Ic susp ,
see
.Ic send
above).
.Tp Ic netdata
Toggles the display of all network data (in hexadecimal format).
The initial value for this toggle is FALSE.
.Tp Ic options
Toggles the display of some internal
.Nm telnet
protocol processing (having to do with
.Li TELNET
options).
The initial value for this toggle is FALSE.
.Tp Ic prettydump
When the
.Ic netdata
or
.Ic termdata
toggle is enabled, if
.Ic prettydump
is enabled the output from the
.Ic netdata
and
.Ic termdata
command will be formated in a more user readable format.
Spaces are put between each character in the output, and the
beginning of any
.Li TELNET
escape sequence is preceded by a '*' to aid in locating them.
.Tp Ic skiprc
When the
.Ic skiprc
toggle
is TRUE, then
.Nm telnet
will skip the reading of the
.Pa \&.telnetrc
file in the users home directory
when connections are opened.
The initial value for this toggle is FALSE.
.Tp Ic termdata
Toggles the display of all terminal data (in hexadecimal format).
The initial value for this toggle is FALSE.
.Tp Ic verbose_encrypt
When the
.Ic verbose_encrypt
toggle is TRUE, then
.Nm telnet
will print out a message each time encryption is
enabled or disabled.
The initial value for this toggle is FALSE.
.Tp Ic \&?
