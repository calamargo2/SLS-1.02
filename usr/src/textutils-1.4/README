These are the GNU text file (actually, file contents) processing
utilities.  Most of these programs have significant advantages over
their Unix counterparts, such as greater speed, additional options,
and fewer arbitrary limits.

The cmp program has moved to the GNU diff distribution.

See the file NEWS for a list of major changes in the current release.

See the file INSTALL for compilation and installation instructions.

The textutils are intended to be POSIX.2 compliant (with BSD and other
extensions), like the rest of the GNU system.  They are almost there,
but a few incompatibilities remain.

The comprehensive Texinfo documentation for these programs is not
finished yet, and needs to be rewritten.  In the interim, the skeletal
man pages provided with this distribution will have to serve.

Although these programs have no `-V' or `--version' option, you can
check which version you have by using the RCS `ident' command on the
binaries, or by using `grep' and `strings -' on them, e.g.,
`strings - /usr/local/bin/ls | grep textutils'.
