	Log of changes made to Minicom.

- Somewhere in middle 1991
	Made first version of Minicom, based on a not-yet-finished
	window library of Fred van Kempen. Used Non blocking IO
	patches to the kernel for asynchronous IO. Used lots of
	CPU time.
	Decided later to write my own window routines.
	Did away with non blocking IO, started to use a separate
	process for the IO from keyboard to modem.
	Added color routines, perfected communication between
	"keyserv" and minicom.
	Got it running under BSD.

- Februari, 1992.
	Posted Minix version 1.2 to comp.os.minix. Got some feedback ;
	it even ran under Coherent. Changed keyserv to communicate
	with minicom through pipes. Changed some menu's and command
	line interface. Ported it to Sysv an Linux. Changed the
	configuration file to ASCII. Added redialing.

- June, 1992.
	Posted version 1.3 to comp.os.minix.
	Did not seem to work under Linux. Added ~NOECHONL to routines
	in sysdep1.c. Added special Linux case hard coded escape
	sequence for color. Found bug in window.c:wscroll. In full
	screen mode insert line / delete line did not work OK.
	Found bug in window.c:wdelchar. Character under the cursor
	was not correctly deleted. Found bug in keyserv: when running
	an external command (up/download, runscript) and ^A or some
	ALT combination was pressed, keyserv would send too many
	ACK signals back so that minicom would be killed. Now call
	m_flush(0) in ipc.c:keyserv before re-starting keyserv.
	(Posix signal interface could solve this ; however, a lot of
	systems don't have that including Minix 1.5).
	Changed DCD handling ; minicom first tried to find out for 
	itself it the OS and modem supported the DCD line. Now it's
	a configuration option in "modem and dialing".
	Found bug in keyserv.c for Coherent: used #ifdef COHERENT
	instead of _COHERENT. Did not hear about this from Coherent
	users... Perhaps it works magically or they're just not
	interested.
