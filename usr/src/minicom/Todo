TODO for version 1.3:

- Use official termcap entries for line character set (if there are)
- Official termcap entries for color...
- VT100 emulation is probably not complete (don't have doc's), but good
  enough for most applications (including Unix).
  Still missing:
  	- Emulation of keypad keys in applications mode
  	- Switching character sets
  	- Double width / double height / 132 characters
  	- Line printer support
  	- Setting tab stops (now hardcoded TAB=8 spaces)
  	- LED functions.
  As you see, none of these are likely to be needed much.
- A scroll-back buffer would be a *very* handy gimmick.

- Probably Viditel (Prestel) support will be added.

- There is still a bug in the DCD detection ; sometimes Minicom does not
  see that DCD has dropped. There is also an emulation mode for systems
  that don't have DCD detection. If Minicom thinks a system does not have
  DCD, it fakes the on and offline messages (and on/offline appear in
  CAPITALS). Sometimes, on systems with DCD, it switches to on- and offline
  in capitals. Hmmmm..... If someone could give me a clue on this..
  (be warned: the code in main.c is quite obscure.)

- I am thinking of a builtin up/download protocol, that allows one to
  up and download *in the background* invisible to the user. One way to do
  this is to use bytes >= 128 for the up and download protocol, and
  bytes < 128 for communication. Ofcourse this always needs an 8 bit
  clean data path, and "normal" data communication cant use the highest
  bit. A special program should be written for the remote side, using
  pty's. This will probably not be coming soon, and if I write it
  eventually it will not fit into Minix's 64K code space. So it will
  have to wait until I get rich and can afford a 386...
