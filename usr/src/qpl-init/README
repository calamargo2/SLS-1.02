Although there are other people working on init/getty/login,
I couldn't wait.  Being dumped into root is not so nice.

There is no getty here.  I put /bin/login in the getty field of /etc/ttytab.

What is here:
	a patch to init/main.c that makes it exec /etc/init.
	init.c
	getttyent.c
	getttynam.c
	ttyent.h (from BSD)
	login.c

init.c:
	written based on sunos init(8) manpage.  differences are
	that the -sb switches are ignored, the window="command" in
	/etc/ttytab is ignored, runs only /etc/rc and ignores
	the result code, utmp and wtmp are not updated, SIGTERM
	is ignored, does not create /etc/ttys, and any
	undiscovered bugs.
	since the manpage doesn't say how the getty entry in
	/etc/ttytab is parsed, using strtok seems reasonable.
	works for /dev/tty0 in 0.11.  should be able to hang
	terminals off the serial ports, but i can't test it
	without terminals or cables.

getttyent.c, getttynam.c, ttyent.h:
	functions to read /etc/ttytab.

login.c:
	does the basic login stuff.  accepts and ignores -p switch.
	uses stuff in getttyent.o and getttynam.o to set TERM.
	makes a better filler in /etc/ttytab than /bin/sh, making
	it easier to avoid being root.
