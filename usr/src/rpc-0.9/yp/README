I've essentially finished my client (re-)implimentation of YP for 386BSD.
I've tried to make it compatible to sun's. I'm feeling lazy though when it
comes to implimenting the getpwent() style functions... Basically what I
have is all the functions in the sun manual page ypclnt(3N), ypbind(8),
ypcat(1), ypmatch(1) and ypwhich(1).

If anyone wants a little project either grab the source out of my home
directory on ref.tfs.com, or send me mail and I'll send it to you.
I don't figure that hacking getpwent(), getgrent(), gethostent(), etc..
and friends to do this should take all that much work.

Anyone interested??
