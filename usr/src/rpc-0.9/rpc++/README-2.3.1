Version 2.3.1 fixes some warnings and ANSI C++ violations discovered
by gcc-2.3.3 and clarifies include statements as suggested by Doug
Moore (dougm@cs.rice.edu). It also includes the gcc-2.3.3 version of
the gcc-2.2 patch. It's a pity that you still need to patch gcc in
order to compile rpc++.  I have re-sent the bug report and someone
from cygnus replied that things should be fixed in the next gcc
release.

Interactive Unix is no longer supported, simply because I replaced it
with Linux on my 386-box (clearer, faster, cheaper). rpc++ compiles
under Linux "out of the box" with the 4.2 development environment
(after you have patched and recompiled gcc, of course).
