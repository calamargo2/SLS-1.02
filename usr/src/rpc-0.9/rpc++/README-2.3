Version 2.3 fixes some bugs and adds a few methods that have shown to be
needed for a complex application. The methods are:

RpcService::ReserveService
  Allocates an unused service number at runtime.

RpcService::Unregister
  Unregisters (i.e., provides no longer) a service.

RpcService::Provide (timeval&)
  Previously only available without argument. Provides services for
  a limited time or until a request has been handled.

RpcStub::ReCall
  May be used from within an error handle to repeat a call after the cause
  of its failure has been fixed.

StdHdrs/rpc contains a new version of xdr.h with better (more precise)
function prototypes contributed by Doug Moore (dougm@cs.rice.edu).
