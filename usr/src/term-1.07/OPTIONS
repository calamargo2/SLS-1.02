Term now takes a number of options.
There are...

	-c off  Turn off compression. Still does error correction. Useful
		for file transfers where subject matter is already compressed.
		Default is compression on.
	-n <on|off> Turn on or off printing out any line noise that term
		gets. Line noise includes talk requests, write's, biff's etc
		default is off.
	-f<number> Makes term flow control happy. What this means is
		that every now and then , term will send an XON
		character to make sure the remote end doesn't 'hang'.
		<number> dictates how often the XON is sent. Zero
		means never, 10 means 1 in every 11 characters sent is
		an XON.
	-d<number> set debugging to <number> A good value is 478. 511 turns
		on all debugging. eg "-d511". Default is 0.

	-s<number> set baud rate to <number> eg. "-s2400" default is
		2400 baud.

	-w<number> sets the window size to number. Higher numbers produce 
		better performance on noisy lines. Lower number produce 
		(much) better responce time. Default is 3.
	-t<timeout> How long to wait untill a packet times out. Measured in
		1/20th of a second. Default is 50
	-o    	Turn on forceing.  If the packet window is full, and there
		is nothing actually ready give to the modem, then force a
		re-transmit of the oldest packet. Off by default.

	-l<filename> Output all log/noise/debugging to the file <filename>.

	-v<filename> Set the modem device to be <filename>. Approprite usage
		is something like '-v/dev/ttys1'

	-1	Tell term to use stdout, instead of stdin as the modem port.
		This will be ignored if a -v is also present.

Environment variables.

BAUDRATE
	Used by term to set the baudrate. Defaults to 2400 if not set.


SHELL

DISPLAY
	Xconn when starting up will attempt to get the socket to bind from
	here. If it starts with a ':' then it is assumed to be of the form
	":<number>", and the socket bound will be /tmp/.X11-unix/X<number>

TERMDIR
	Where to make/use the .term directory.

HOME
	Where to make/use the .term directory if TERMDIR isn't set.
