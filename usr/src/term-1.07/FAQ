1) Term doesn't work! Why not!!

	This is one of the most tremendously useful questions I have
ever been asked. You will notice that it contains all the pertinent
information I might want to know, like what version of term they are
useing, and exactly what the symtoms are, and what machine they are
running it on, and what they have tried, etc etc. However here are a
few things to try before mailing me with details. :)

	a) Create a ~/.term/termrc file at both ends with the two
lines "escape 0-31" and "escape 128-159" in it. Then try term. If this
work, try shortening the ranges as much as possible. Experience
indicates that most people will be able to get away with either
nothing, or "escape 17" and "escape 19", or escapeing 17, 19, 145 and
147. 

	b) If 'a' doesn't work, it's possible that you have a
seven-bit line. Try useing a termrc with the two lines.. "sevenbit"
and "escape 0-31" in it. It is important to know that the termrc at
each end must have 'sevenbit' in it.

2) Term doesn't run as fast as it should. Why not??

	Several ways to speed up term. Here are the most common...
a) Escape as few characters as possible. escapeing 32 characters will
cut thru-put by about 12-15%.

b) If you escape a character on one end, add a corresponding 'ignore'
on the other. I.e. if you 'escape 17' on the remote end, put a 'ignore
17' on the local end.
