       _F_t_p_d is the DARPA Internet File Transfer  Protocol  server
       process.   The server uses the TCP protocol and listens at
       the port specified in the ``ftp''  service  specification;
       see _s_e_r_v_i_c_e_s(5).

       If  the  --dd  option is specified, debugging information is
       written to the syslog.

       If the --ll option is specified, each ftp session is  logged
       in the syslog.

       The  ftp  server will timeout an inactive session after 15
       minutes.  If the --tt option is  specified,  the  inactivity
       timeout  period  will be set to _t_i_m_e_o_u_t seconds.  A client
       may also request a different timeout period;  the  maximum
       period  allowed  may be set to _t_i_m_e_o_u_t seconds with the --TT
       option.  The default limit is 2 hours.

       If the --aa option is specified, the use of the _f_t_p_a_c_c_e_s_s(5)
       configuration file is enabled.

       If  the  --AA  option  is specified, use of the _f_t_p_a_c_c_e_s_s(5)
       configuration file is disabled.

       If the --LL  option  is  specified,  commands  sent  to  the
       _f_t_p_d(8)  server  will  be  logged  to  the syslog.  The --LL

       If  the  --ii  option  is  specified,  files received by the
       _f_t_p_d(8) server will be logged to the _x_f_e_r_l_o_g(5).   The  --ii

       If the --oo option is specified, files  transmitted  by  the
       _f_t_p_d(8)  server  will  be  logged  to  the syslog.  The --oo

       when  the  ABOR command is preceded by a Telnet "Interrupt
       Process" (IP) signal and a Telnet "Synch"  signal  in  the
       command  Telnet  stream, as described in Internet RFC 959.
       If a STAT command is received during a data transfer, pre-
       ceded  by  a  Telnet IP and Synch, transfer status will be
       returned.

       _F_t_p_d interprets file names according to  the  ``globbing''
       conventions  used by _c_s_h(1).  This allows users to utilize
       the metacharacters ``*?[]{}~''.

       _F_t_p_d authenticates users according to three rules.

       1)     The user name must be in the  password  data  base,
              _/_e_t_c_/_p_a_s_s_w_d, and not have a null password.  In this
              case a password must  be  provided  by  the  client
              before any file operations may be performed.

       2)     The   user   name  must  not  appear  in  the  file
              _/_e_t_c_/_f_t_p_u_s_e_r_s.

       3)     The user must have a  standard  shell  returned  by
              _g_e_t_u_s_e_r_s_h_e_l_l(3).

       4)     If  the  user  name is ``anonymous'' or ``ftp'', an
              anonymous ftp account must be present in the  pass-
              word file (user ``ftp'').  In this case the user is
              allowed to log in by specifying  any  password  (by
              convention  this  is  given  as  the  client host's
              name).

       In the last case, _f_t_p_d takes special measures to  restrict
       the  client's  access  privileges.   The server performs a
       _c_h_r_o_o_t(2) command to the home  directory  of  the  ``ftp''
       user.   In  order that system security is not breached, it
       is recommended that the  ``ftp''  subtree  be  constructed
       with care;  the following rules are recommended.

       ~ftp)  Make  the  home  directory  owned  by  ``ftp''  and
              unwritable by anyone.

       ~ftp/bin)
              Make this directory owned  by  the  super-user  and
              unwritable  by  anyone.   The program _l_s(1) must be
              present to support the list command.  This  program
              should have mode 111.

       ~ftp/etc)
              Make  this  directory  owned  by the super-user and
              unwritable by  anyone.   The  files  _p_a_s_s_w_d(5)  and
              _g_r_o_u_p(5)  must  be present for the _l_s command to be
              able to produce owner names  rather  than  numbers.
              The  password  field  in  _p_a_s_s_w_d  is  not used, and
              should not contain real encrypted passwords.  These

              files should be mode 444.

       ~ftp/pub)
              Make  this directory mode 777 and owned by ``ftp''.
              Users should then  place  files  which  are  to  be
              accessible via the anonymous account in this direc-
              tory.

       The  anonymous  account is inherently dangerous and should
       avoided when possible.

       The server must run as the super-user  to  create  sockets
       with  privileged  port numbers.  It maintains an effective
       user id of the logged in user, reverting to the super-user
       only  when  binding  addresses  to  sockets.  The possible
       security holes have been extensively scrutinized, but  are
       possibly incomplete.
