SEMI-IMPORTANT RELEASE NOTES

This is an INTERIM release of my modified FTP server.  Because work on
the server has been stalled for a long time, and because lots of people
seem to want to do the things this server DOES do, I'm releasing this
version.  To the best of my knowledge, it works and has no major bugs.
The features are all incremental, and with one exception, are
completely compatible with existing FTP clients.  The exception is the
multi-line messages the server will use to respond to many commands
when some features are enabled, for example:

	OLD STYLE FTP

	ftp> cd /pub
	220 CWD command successful.

	THIS FTP

	ftp> cd /pub
    220-Please read the file README
    220-  it was last modified on Thu Feb 21 10:35:09 1991 - 214 days ago
	220 CWD command successful.

Some of the older FTP clients, which do not conform to the FTP
specifications, barf on these multi-line messages.  Multi-line messages
can be disabled on a per-connection basis by using a dash (-) as the
first character of the user's password.

REALLY IMPORTANT RELEASE NOTES

The next release of the FTP server is going to include some significant
changes.  The most important one is that the logging format for file
transfers is going to be completely different, and quite incompatible.
There will probably *NOT* be any program provided to convert your old
logfiles to the new format.

SOME CAVEATS

I've tested the server on a number of different machines around campus,
and I believe that it can be made to work on most BSD-compatible
systems with a minimal amount of work.  I welcome any and all bug
reports you may have, but *PLEASE* do not send me any "foo system"
compatibility patches.  The server isn't finished yet because I don't
have time to work on it, so do you really think that I have time to
integrate your patches for a system that I have no way to test them
on?!

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1.  make depend

    (mkdep is in support/mkdep if you need it).

    On some systems you may need to change the line that reads "cc -M $*"
    to "cc -Em $*" to get mkdep to work -- even more bizarre changes
    made be needed on other systems.  If you can't get mkdep to work
    fairly easily, SKIP THIS STEP, it's not essential and you don't
    need to bang your head on the wall at this early point in the
    betatest.

    [note: the make depend step is really only important if you are
    making changes to the code and don't want to re-compile everything
    every time.  If you cannot get make depend to work, just do a
	"make clean all" in step 5.]

2.  edit Makefile, changing variables as appropriate

    BINDIR      where normal (user) binaries are stored
    ETCDIR      where system binaries are stored
    MANDIR      where manpages are stored
    MISSINGOBJS what library routines your system is missing:
                    one or more of: getusershell.o fnmatch.o strerror.o
                                    strsep.o getgrent.o authuser.o

    NOTE:   ftpd requires the latest Berkeley getgrent code.  If the linker
            complains about setgroupent(), you must include getgrent.o as
            part of MISSINGOBJS.  This code doesn't deal with hesiod serving
            of groups, passwords, etc... only /etc/group.

3.  edit pathnames.h to conform to your needs, edit support/paths.h as well

4.  create an ftpaccess file if you want one (as a betatester you SHOULD)

5.  make

    If cc complains about strunames, typenames, modenames, ... being undefined
    you need to install support/ftp.h as /usr/include/arpa/ftp.h (always make
    a backup of the old ftp.h just in case!) and do the make again.  The new
    ftp.h should be a compatible superset of your existing ftp.h, so you
    shouldn't have problems with this replacement.

6   make install

7.  edit /etc/inetd.conf to point to the new ftpd

8.  kill -1 `ps t"?" | grep inetd`

9.  for the server to support creation of .tar.Z files of directories, you
    need GNU tar installed [remember to put a copy in the anonymous ftp
    hierarchy].  If you need a copy, it is available from
    wuarchive.wustl.edu [128.252.135.4] in /gnu.

10. copy /wherever/compress to ~ftp/bin/compress and put a link to
    /wherever/compress in /bin.

NOTES:  Some machines may not have a definition of pid_t; so if your compiler
        complains about this you should add (in all the appropriate places)

            typedef int pid_t;
