# This is a sample Bourne shell script to log a user onto a remote system.
# Things to remember:
#	1) Script files should have permissions of 700, to prevent others
#	from gaining access to your passwords to remote systems.
#	2) The return codes for waitfor are: 0=success, 1=timed out, and
#	-1=error.
