xkeycaps is a graphical front-end to xmodmap.  It opens a window that looks
like a keyboard; moving the mouse over a key shows what KeySyms and Modifier
bits that key generates.  Clicking on a key simulates KeyPress/KeyRelease
events on the window of your choice.  It is possible to change the KeySyms
and Modifiers generated by a key through a mouse-based interface.  This
program can also write an input file for xmodmap to recreate your changes
in future sessions.  See the man page for more details.

xkeycaps currently knows about the following types of keyboards:

    Sun type2 (MIT layout)		    Sony NWS 1250
    Sun type3 (MIT layout)		    DEC LK201
    Sun type4 (MIT layout)		    DEC LK401
    Sun type5 (MIT layout)		    DEC LK421
    Sun type5/PC (MIT layout)		    IBM RS/6000
    Sun type4 (OpenWindows layout)	    SCO 110
    Sun type5 (OpenWindows layout)	    HP 300/400/700 series
    Sun type5/PC (OpenWindows layout)	    HP 700/RX X Terminal
    NCD N97				    HP PC
    NCD N101				    Atari TT
    NCD N102				    DELL PC
    NCD N102 (Swedish/Finnish layout)	    Labtam
    NCD N102 (Norwegian layout)		    Tektronix XP20 (r4)
    NCD N102 (French layout)		    Tektronix XP20 (r5)
    NCD N108				    Tektronix VT200 (Ultrix)
    NCD vt220				    TI Explorer
    Silicon Graphics Iris/Indigo

If you're using a keyboard not on this list and would like to make xkeycaps
know about it, read the file defining.txt.  Adding a new keyboard type isn't
hard, just a little tedious.  Please send me any changes/additions you make!

I have not personally tested any keyboard definitions except those of the
Sun[234] and NCD N97 keyboards, because that's all I have access to.  Please
let me know if you find any problems (especially with the "Restore Default Map"
command.)

(Hint for HP users: use "cc -Aa".  See the man page for details.)
