DESCRIPTION
  _l_y_a_p generates and graphically displays an array of Lyapunov exponents for
  a variety of iterated periodically forced non-linear maps of the unit
  interval.

OPTIONS

  -C _n    Specifies the minimum color index to be used for negative exponents

  -D _n    Specifies the "dwell" or number of iterations over which to average
          in order to calculate the Lyapunov exponent. Default is 400.

  -B      Causes the stop, go, spin and quit buttons to be displayed.

  -H _n    Specifies the height of the window. Default is 256.

  -L      Indicates use log(x) + log(y) rather than log(xy).

  -M _r    Specifies the real value to compare exponent values to for indexing
          into a color wheel. The default value is 1.0.

  -O _n    Specifies the minimum color index to be used for positive exponents

  -R _p    Specifies pseudo-random forcing with probability _p of using parame-
          ter value 'a'.

  -S _n    Specifies the "settle" or number of iterations prior to the begin-
          ning of the calculation of the Lyapunov exponent. Default is 200.

  -W _n    Specifies the width of the window. Default is 256.

  -a _r    Specifies the real value to use as the minimum parameter value of
          the horizontal axis. Default is 3.0 for the logistic map.

  -b _n    Specifies the real value to use as the minimum parameter value of
          the vertical axis. Default is 3.0 for the logistic map.

  -c _n    Selects one of six different color wheels to use. The default color
          wheel is a rainbow palette.

  -F _1_0_1_0_1_0_1_0
          Specifies the "Function" forcing function to use. The example above
          would alternate between iterating the circle and logistic maps. An
          argument of "-F 2323" would alternate between left and right logis-
          tic maps. The default is to only use the single specified map (see
          the description of -m).

  -f _a_b_b_a_b_a_a_b
          Specifies the forcing function to use. The default is to alternate
          between the "a" parameter and the "b" parameter.

  -h _r    Specifies the real value to be used as the range over which the
          vertical parameter values vary. The default is 1.0.

  -i _r    Specifies the real value of the initial condition to use. Default
          is 0.05.

  -m _n    Selects between available non-linear maps of the unit interval. A
          value of 0 specifies the logistic map. A value of 1, the circle
          map. A value of 2, the left-logistic. A value of 3, the right-
          logistic. A value of 4, the double-logistic. The default is 0, the
          logistic map.

  -o _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
          Specifies the output filename to be used. If the -o option is
          given, this file will automatically be written out at the comple-
          tion of the drawing.  If it is not specified, a default filename of
          lyap.out is used and only written if the 'f' or 'F' keys are
          pressed during a run. The format of the output file is PPM for
          color and PGM for monochrom. The parameters used to calculate the
          picture are included as comments at the beginning of the output
          file.

  -p      Switches color indices for negative and positive exponents. Gen-
          erally, causes negative exponents to be displayed in more detail
          while darkening and narrowing the color range for positive
          exponents. This can be toggled during runtime by pressing the 'p'
          key.

  -r _n    Specifies the maximum rgb value to be used. Default is 35000.

  -s _n    Specifies the length of the color wheel spin.

  -u      Produces a usage message.

  -v      Prints out the various values to be used and exits.

  -w _r    Specifies the real value to be used as the range over which the
          horizontal parameter values vary. The default is 1.0.

  -x _n    Specifies the x screen coordinate of the window (default is 256).

  -y _n    Specifies the y screen coordinate of the window (default is 256).



NOTES

  During display, pressing any mouse button allows you to select the area to
  be investigated with the mouse. The upper left hand corner of the desired
  area is the location of the cursor when the button is pressed. The lower
  right hand corner is specified by the cursor when the button is released.

  The algorithm was taken from the September 1991 Scientific American article
  by A. K. Dewdney who gives credit to Mario Markus of the Max Planck Insti-
  tute for its creation. Additional information and ideas were gleaned from
  the discussion on alt.fractals involving Stephen Hall, Ed Kubaitis, Dave
  Platt and Baback Moghaddam. Assistance with colormaps and spinning color
  wheels and X was gleaned from Hiram Clawson. Rubber banding code was
  adapted from an existing Mandelbrot program written by Stacey Campbell.
