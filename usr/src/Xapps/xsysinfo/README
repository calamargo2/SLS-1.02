README for xsysinfo version 1.1.

WHAT IS XSYSINFO:

xsysinfo is an X application to display some Linux kernel
parameters in graphical form. It is like a mix of top, free and xload
with the difference that the values are shown in form of a horizontal bar.
The displayed values are: CPU load, CPU idle, memory and swap sizes
(details see below).

Xsysinfo 1.1 runs at least under Linux 0.99pl2 with the proc filesystem
(to get the CPU idle time, you also have to patch the kernel; the patch file
is included in this archive). 


WHAT HAVE CHANGED SINCE xsysinfo 1.0?

o	proc filesystem

   I have completely rewritten the code to get the kernel params. It now uses
   the proc filesystem, which made the whole stuff a lot easier. Another
   advantage of the proc fs is, that xsysinfo can run under normal permissions
   and need not to be recompiled with every new kernel release. The only 
   problem with the (current version of the) proc filesystem is, that it has 
   no support for the CPU idle time. I made some changes to the kernel and 
   added a new `file' /proc/idle to proc fs, which always reports the current 
   total idle time of the CPU. That's why you have to apply the included patch
   to the kernel. Maybe Linus will add this feature to future kernel 
   releases...


o	memory display changed

   The two gauges for memory and cache sizes are now merged together. The
   new gauge is still in form of a bar, but is subdivided into three `segments',
   each displayed in a different color. The meaning of the three segments
   is: buffer cache, shared part of memory, non-shared part of memory. The 
   length of the whole bar is proportional to the amount of all used memory.


o	more than one swap area supported

   The gauge for swap size is now also subdivided, one `segment' for each
   swap file/partition.


o	gauges now can be disabled

   Now it is possible to disable each of the gauges either through 
   application resources or through command line options. 



FOR THE IMPATIENT:

If you want to take a look at xsysinfo, before you decide to install it,
make sure the proc fs is mounted at /proc, then just type:

  XAPPLRESDIR=. xsysinfo &

or

  XAPPLRESDIR=. xsysinfo -noidle &

if the proc fs in your kernel doesn't supports the `idle' file.


HOW TO INSTALL:

There is a compiled xsysinfo included in the archive, which needs the new
X distribution (XFree-1.1) with the 4.2 jump libs. If you  If you want to
install this binary just type

make install

as root. xsysinfo runs under normal (755) permissions, so you don't have to
make it setuid/setgid.

NOTE: Use this way to install xsysinfo! `make install' not only copies the 
binary to the right place, it also installs the system wide application 
defaults file (XSysinfo). Without this file you'll get a running xsysinfo,
but it won't look very nice... 

NOTE: If you run the SLS release of Linux, you have to recompile xsysinfo,
because the X version in current SLS distribution is still XFree-1.0. The
binary version requires the 2.1 shared libs of XFree-1.1.

If you want to create your own compiled version just type:

xmkmf
make

(you'll need the programming package and the libraries from the XFree
distribution to do this.)
Now you can install it as described above.

xsysinfo requires that the proc filesystem is compiled into the kernel
(this is the default anyway) and that it is mounted on directory /proc.
This is usually the case, if you have SLS or use the procps package from
Michael K. Johnson. To check this just do an `ls' on /proc, which should
give something like this:

$ ls /proc
1/       21/      27/      39/      42/      52/      kmsg     uptime
14/      22/      28/      4/       44/      75/      loadavg
15/      23/      29/      40/      46/      87/      meminfo
20/      24/      38/      41/      47/      idle     self/

To mount the proc filesystem, add the following line to your /etc/fstab:

none            /proc           proc    defaults        # proc fs

The file `/proc/idle' doesn't exists in the current implementation (0.99.pl3)
of the proc fs, but it is required by xsysinfo to display the CPU idle time.
There is a patch file (linux-99.2.idle.pch) included in this archive, which
modifies the kernel to report the idle times. 

It is not absolutely neccessary to patch the kernel: you can run xsysinfo
with the idle gauge disabled (see options). 


WHAT IS DISPLAYED:

Xsysinfo displays the following values:

  - CPU load
	CPU load average between 0.000-1.000.

  - CPU idle
	percentage CPU idle time to real time.

  - Memory
	The memory gauge's bar is subdivided into three smaller parts, called 
        `segments', with following values (from left to right):

	o	amount of physical memory, which is not shared among
		processes (i.e. private process data).

	o	amount of physical memory, which is shared among
		processes (i.e. mainly process code and const data)

	o	physical memory used for the buffer cache

	The length of the whole bar, which is the sum of these three values,
	shows the amount of physical memory currently used by the system.

  - Swap
	The swap gauge is also subdivided into segments, one for each active
	swap partition or swap file. The displayed value is the amount of 
	swap space in use in that partition/file. The whole bar's length is
	proportional to the total size of the swap space used by the system.



COMMAND LINE OPTIONS:

  xsysinfo accepts the following command line options:

	-update <n>		set update rate to <n> seconds
	-title (-notitle)	show (don't show) title string
	-load  (-noload)	show (don't show) CPU load value
	-idle  (-noidle)	show (don't show) CPU idle value
	-mem   (-nomem)		show (don't show) Memory info
	-swap  (-noswap)	show (don't show) Swap info
	-help			show usage

  You can also specify any of the standard toolkit options (see: manpage X(1)).



CONFIGURATION:

  As the most X programs, xsysinfo is highly configurable. Look at the file
  XSysinfo.ad or /usr/X386/lib/X11/app-defaults/XSysinfo, if you have installed
  the program already, and play around with the resources in it. Especially if 
  you have a color monitor, you should change the current settings, to make the
  gauges come up colored. As I just have a grayscale monitor, you'll probably
  find the current color settings not quite good. So feel free to mail me
  your favorite settings, I'll make the best one available in the next
  release.
