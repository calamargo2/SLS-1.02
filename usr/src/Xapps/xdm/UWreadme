I'm making this available because Jim DeRoest says there's interest out
there.  I don't recall having any difficulty building this on AIX 3, except
in that our X11R4 libraries are in the wrong directories because of IBM
upgrade policies.  I didn't fix that in the Imakefile, just made a little
script `ld' that fixed it.

In truth, we do not use this program much at this writing, but I did run it
once and found it to be in working order.
