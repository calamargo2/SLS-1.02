===== Changes from BootLin 1.3 to 1.4 ========================================= 
	It's not really here now, because Linux doesn't like it yet, but 
the main new functionality is that you will be able to boot Linux directly 
from the DOS command line. 
 
===== Changes from BootLin 1.2 to 1.3 ========================================= 
	Added a check of the boot sector to be a REAL BIOS BOOT SECTOR. This 
will avoid, I hope, to try to boot with everything, and more especially with 
the system executable, like one of my friends did... 
 
	BootLinux now sets the memory to zero before loading the image. With 
this linux hangs less often. 
 
	If the name given on the command line refers to no real file, then 
you are prompted for a new file name, until the name is correct. This should 
allow, for those using multiple kernels, the use of only one command line in 
the config.sys to boot whatever version of linux they want. 
 
	Sorry, I could not avoid Bootlin.com to be more than 1K this time ! 
 
===== Changes from BootLin 1.1 to 1.2 ========================================= 
	I think I have now corrected the bug that hung some computers and 
made everyone have garbage in place of the "Press <RETURN> to see SVGA modes". 
 
	If the ROOT device number is not defined, it allows you to choose 
it within some devices. 
 
	It has a far more simple command line parsing routine. That allowed 
to save about 33% of the size, which in turn allowed the new BootLinux to 
be smaller than the old one. Drawback: no checking is done. Anyway, 
it has the same syntax than the previous BootLinux. 
 
	I now give a MASM source !
