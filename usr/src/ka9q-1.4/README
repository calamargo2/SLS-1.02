This version of KA9Q net is from the original port by Klement Anders with
oversight from Bob Hoffman at cs.pitt.edu.  There has been one major bug fix and
several minor changes to the original ported code.  This code base as been
in active use for over 18 months and has held up very well with use off of
a digital repeater in southern california.  We here a Interactive Systems
have been using this software and find it to work very well.  One of the
changes that was installed, was when you do the "n ro" command that lists the
netrom routes that you know of, it will tell you how many netrom stations
are in the table.  This becomes important when you have an average list of
100 - 125 stations in the table at a time.

This version runs under System 5 - 386 unix.

Any questions on this can be mailed to:

bobt@ism.isc.com   or
ism!teeter!bobt   which is my machine at home.

To install this software just type INSTALL as a command.
It will check for a shell variable that is the path to where the software
is to be installed.  It then tests for and if necessary creats the directories
to be used.  It then will build the software and install it where it belongs.

Have fun using it ITS GREAT  Thanks Phil.  Thanks Klement.
