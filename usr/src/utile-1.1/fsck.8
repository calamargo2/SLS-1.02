.SH NAME
fsck \- a file system consistency checker for Linux
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "fsck [ \-larvsm ]"
device
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B fsck
performs a consistency check for the Linux MINIX filesystem.  The program
assumes the file system is quiescent.
.B fsck
should not be used on a mounted device unless you can be sure nobody is
writing to it (and remember that the kernel can write to it when it
searches for files).

The device will usually have the following form:
.nf
.RS
/dev/hda[1-8]
/dev/hdb[1-8]
/dev/sda[1-8]
/dev/sdb[1-8]
.RE
.fi

If the file system was changed (i.e., repaired), then
.B fsck
will print "FILE SYSTEM HAS CHANGED" and will
.BR sync (2)
three times before exiting.  Since Linux does not currently have raw
devices, there is
.I no
need to reboot at this time (versus a system which
.I does
have raw devices).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-l
Lists all filenames
.TP
.B \-r
Performs interactive repairs
.TP
.B \-a
Performs automatic repairs (this option implies
.BR \-r ),
and serves to answer all of the questions asked with the default.  Note
that this can be extremely dangerous in the case of extensive file system
damage.
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose
.TP
.B \-s
Outputs super-block information
.TP
.B \-m
Activates MINIX-like "mode not cleared" warnings
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR mkfs (8),
.BR efsck (8),
.BR emkfs (8),
.BR reboot (8)
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
There are numerous diagnostic messages.  The ones mentioned here are the
most commonly seen in normal usage.

If the device does not exist,
.B fsck
will print "unable to read super block".  If the device exists, but is not
a MINIX file system,
.B fsck
will print "bad magic number in super-block".
