mount/umount/swapon/swapoff(8) for Linux 0.99.2
===============================================

Here is a new version of Doug Quale's mount/umount package that
includes support for mounting and unmount NFS filesystems.  It is
still possible to compile it without NFS support by modifying the
Makefile.  Even if you don't have rpcgen, but do have libc-4.2
you can "cp -p" the pre-generated files in the rpcsvc directory
into the mount source directory.

The primary difference besides the actual NFS mounting code is that
mount understands hostname:/path syntax for the "device" as well as
the new keyword "none" which is useful for the proc filesystem.  Also,
umount had to be trained to specify the mount-point instead of the
device when unmounting such filesystems.  For compatibility,
filesystems with true devices are unmounted using their device name
which will still work with older kernels.  However, all umounts could
just as well be done by specifying the mount point instead of the
device.

Other changes since the beta NFS mount are:

* incorportated H.J. Lu's changes for mtab permissions and errno handling
* corrected the error message for unhandled errors from mount and umount
* improved (a little :-) the reporting of handled mount and umount errors
* added the ability to NFS mount from a IP address as well as a hostname
* added a string error message instead of numeric for failed NFS mounts
* changed 32 to _NSIG when setting all signals (should be using sigismember)
* eliminated the obsolete HAVE_MOUNT5 and HAVE_SWAPOFF ifdefs
* added support for the sync and async mount options
* added the noauto option for fstab entries that shouldn't get mounted with -a
* changed mount -a to check the mtab for already mounted filesystems
* eliminated a few new warning messages from gcc 2.3.3
* wrote an nfs man page

Features still missing:

* ability to background NFS mounts that have timed out
* notify the NFS server of umounts (but addr=ip-addr support is in there)
* add the possibility of interrupting an in-progress mount
* man pages for the other Linux filesystem types

mount/umount/swapon/swapoff(8) for Linux 0.98.5
===============================================

This version fixed the umask of root. fchmod () is called
before close /etc/mtab. This version should work with
0.97.3 or above, although I only tested it under 0.98.5.
I also fixed the error report.

mount/umount/swapon/swapoff(8) for Linux 0.97.3
===============================================

The most significant improvement over the first release is the repair of
at least a half dozen really dumb bugs, mostly involving null pointers. 
These bugs caused frequent core dumps and really made the code unusable.

Some race conditions in the lock handling code have been removed.

Swapoff is available for 0.97.3 and later kernels.

Swapon supports multiple swap files.  In particular, swapon -a will try
to enable swapping on all the swap entries in /etc/fstab.

File system specific mount options are now supported.  This is of particular
utility with Werner Almesberger's msdos fs.

Umount -a now reads /etc/mtab instead of /etc/fstab (thanks to David
Engel for a valuable discussion on this and other points).  In addition,
it umounts the entries in reverse order, ensuring that it tries to umount
/usr/spool before /usr, for instance.

Mount will now print mtab for ordinary users as well as for the superuser.
Several people pointed out this deficiency, and it was a real no-brainer
that broke it in the first release.

Thanks to Linus, for another great release.  0.97.3 compiled the first time
out and is working flawlessly.  Thanks also to Ross Biro, for his work on
Linux TCP/IP which has made it much easier to get this little thing off my
machine.  Special thanks to everyone who put up with my bugs.

Brickbats etc. to
