       sseelleeccttiioonn is  a  utility  that  allows  characters  to  be
       selected  from the current Linux virtual console using the
       mouse and pasted into the current  console.  sseelleeccttiioonn  is
       normally invoked at boot time from /etc/rc.local, and runs
       as a background process.

       To invoke the selection mechanism, press and  release  the
       left  mouse button (the meaning of the left and right-hand
       buttons may be  reversed  at  compile  time;  consult  the
       installation notes). A highlighted block will start moving
       around the screen, correlated with  the  movement  of  the
       mouse.

       Move  the  block  to the first character of the selection,
       then press and hold down the left mouse button.

       Drag out the selection; the selected text  will  be  high-
       lighted.  Then  release  the left button. You can take the
       end of the selection to before the start of the  selection
       if necessary.

       Double-clicking the left-hand button while the highlighted
       block is on the screen selects text  by  word  boundaries;
       treble-clicking  selects by entire lines. If the button is
       held down after double- or treble-clicking, multiple words
       or  lines  may  be  selected.  A word consists of a set of
       alphanumeric characters and underscores.

       If a trailing space after the contents of a line is  high-
       lighted, and if there is no other text on the remainder of
       the line, the rest of the line will be selected  automati-
       cally.  If  a  number  of  lines are selected, highlighted
       trailing spaces on each line  will  be  removed  from  the
       selection buffer.

       Pressing  the  right-hand mouse button in any virtual con-
       sole pastes the selected text into the read queue  of  the
       associated tty.

       Any  output  on  the virtual console holding the selection
       will clear the highlighted selection from the  screen,  to
       maintain  integrity  of the display, although the contents
       of the paste buffer will be unaffected.

       The selection mechanism is  disabled  if  the  controlling
       virtual  console  is  placed in graphics mode, for example

       The size of the paste buffer  is  set  at  2048  bytes  by
       default.  This may be changed at compile time; consult the
       installation notes.

       The selection mechanism doesn't work very well with graph-
       ics characters, or indeed with any characters where a map-
       ping between the typed character and the displayed charac-
       ter  is  performed  by  the  console driver. The selection
       mechanism pastes into the input buffer the character codes
       as  they are displayed on the screen, not those originally
       typed in by the user.
