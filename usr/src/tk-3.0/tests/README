Tk Test Suite
--------------

This directory contains a set of validation tests for Tk.
Each of the files whose name ends in ".test" is intended to
fully exercise one or a few Tk features.  The features
tested by a given file are listed in the first line of the
file.  The test suite is nowhere near complete yet.  Contributions
of additional tests would be most welcome.

The simplest way to run a test is to start up wish in this
directory and "source" the test file (for example, type "source
parse.test").  To run all of the tests, type "source all".  If
all goes well then no output will appear (except a listing of
the tests, if you used "source all").  If there are errors
then messages will appear in the format described below.

For more details on the testing environment, see the README
file in the Tcl test directory.
