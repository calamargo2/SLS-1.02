# 
# I just got pointed to your file program, with all the magic numbers.
# Neat.  I enclose a magic file for image formats.  You already have
# a better entry for Sun rasterfiles, so ignore that one.  I made this
# file by going through all the format converters in the PBMPLUS package
# and noting which ones had magic numbers.  Disappointingly few of them
# did.
# 
# By the way, note the comment below about string format.  Am I right
# about this, or does the program handle this problem in some way?

# PBMPLUS auxiliary magic numbers file
#
# All of these entries use the "string" format so that they will work on
# both big-endian and little-endian machines.
