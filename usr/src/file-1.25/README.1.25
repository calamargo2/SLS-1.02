The file-1.25.tar.Z was created as follows:

1) everything in /pub/darwin/file was ftp'd on Thu Dec 24 10:28:11 1992
   from ftp.cs.toronto.edu
2) it was all placed in a directory called file-1.25, since 1.25 is the
   version on the file.c program
3) sh was run on dist.src and dist.magic
4) dist.src and dist.magic were deleted
5) this file was created so you'd know what happend
6) the file-1.25 directory was tar'd.
