This is the ALPHA version of the Linux printer utilities.
It is a MINIMUM working set to get text printout working.
This REALLY DOES SUCK, so don't bother telling me that.
There IS NO:

* Warranty [covered under the GNU Public License, wc]
* accept, deny, lpadmin, lpsched, lpshut or any other NICEITIES.
* There is no guarantee it will compile or run for you

You do get:
* lp, lpd, and a printcap

This was tested under GCC 2.1 and 1.4 [?]. For 1.4 you may need to use the
strdup.c included.
This version will not be developed further. I plan to rewrite it over the
summer in C++.
