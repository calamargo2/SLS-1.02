# Usage:
#	print_file_names [ -d dir ] file_or_dir  [ file_or_dir  ... ]
#
# Prints out each of the file names given by its argument.  If the
# file turns out to be a directory, the contents of that directory
# are printed.  The -d flag says "print the file names relative to <dir>"
# instead of relative to the current directory.  Symbolic links
# are suppressed.

		echo ${file}
