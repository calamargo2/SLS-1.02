       * Version 1.1.1 created, as a bug-fix release while waiting for version
	 1.2.

       * Numerous minor bug fixes incorporated.  User Guide updated. Bugs fixed
	 include:
	 display depth in stix
	 readline character pushback
	 duplicated code in mstcomp (timing code)
	 duplicated code in Makefile
	 couldn't make subclasses of Set and Dictionary
	 indexOfSubcollection: was doing bogus things
	 Collection>>detect: wasn't returning proper value
	 Point and Rectangle didn't have #= and #hash methods
	 Float #storeOn: was recursive
	 Integer #gcd: returned wrong value
	 #False ifFalse: didn't return block's value
	 processes were getting trashed around GC's
	 Manual updated with better instructions for using readline
	 Manual cross references (info node links) fixed
	 Manual indentations fixed
	 st.el requires shell mode now
	 st.el doesn't refer to ~/mst
	 String had two fileName methods

	* Version 1.1 nearing release

	* Dictionary.st: Fixed Dictionary size to return a real value.  It was
	returning 0. 
	Fixed Dictionary grow to preserve assocations instead of creating new
	ones. 
	Fixed Dictionary at:ifAbsent: to deal more gracefully with the failure
	case.
	
	* Float.st: fixed float to contain asFloat

	* builtins.st: added builtin sqrt

	* mstsave.c: fixed binary image save to save proper amount of storage,
	instead of all blocks and methods ... also fixed full GC to clear out
	oop table after copying fined binary image save to save only a subset
	of the object table that's in use instead of the whole things.  This
	change along with the OOP table gc, caused a reduction from 2.5M in
	image file size to 318K.  

	* mstcomp.c: fixed mstcomp to not divide by zero when reporting cache
	hits or elapsed time.
	fixed to deal with error recovery better.  The byte code system was
	being left in an inconsistent state, which was causing great lossage
	after errors.

	* mstmain.c: fixed usage of quietExecution in mstmain.c...was not being
	set under certain circumstances
	added support for short file names (SysV 14 char limit)
	added new flags -c, -q, -p, -I.

	* Makefile,config.mst: fixed Makefile and config system to be more like
	normal GNU tools. 

	* mstinterp.c Fixed primitive file open for FileStream to report errors
	when it	can't open the file.
	Fixed general C-to-method (executeStatements) behavior.  Wasn't
	preserving the caller's stack pointer properly, and so after executing
	a number of top level statements, the return value would trash the
	middle of the top level context, causing lossage.

	* Object.st: Fixed object dependencies to use IdentityDictionary
	instead of Dictionary.  This not only is faster, but is also more
	correct. 

	* mstcint.c: added ByteArray type to set of exported types

	* Time.st: Fixed printOn: to print the value of the instance variable
	instead of printing "Time now".

	* mstoop.c: fixed GC symbol table...wasn't completing scan at GC flip
	time.  Also, new symbols weren't making sure that the previous hash
	bucket head was in new-space, which caused lossage.

	* mstinterp.c: added verboseTracing: to trace stack top during
	execution tracing.
	Added ^C handling to terminate execution.

	* mstcomp.c,mst.y: Fixed to not try to execute if errors are
	encountered during compilation.

	* ./stix: added STIX environment

	* st.el: created Smalltalk interactor mode.

	* added readline interface to provide command line editing and history.

	* mst.texinfo: fixed some bugs in the texinfo file

	* mstinterp.c,ProcessorScheduler.st,Processor.st:
	Fixed so that terminateActive message works for the current process
	and so that random processes laying around don't reference random
	storage.

	* WriteStream.st: fix so that the contents message returns just
	the contents that have been written, not the junk at the end
	of the stream.
