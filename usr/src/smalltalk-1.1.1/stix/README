STIX
====

Welcome to STIX, the SmallTalk Interface to X.

This directory contains the method definitions for an interface to the
X protocol layer which underlies all of X Window.  It is not a complete
implementation of the X protocol: several of the protocol operations have
not been implemented yet, and some which have been are not completely done.

Nevertheless, there is enough here so that simple drawing and event handling
operations can take place.  There's even an implementation of the Pen class
as described in the Blue Book, for doing simple LOGO-like drawing.

OPERATION
=========

Be sure that you have appropriately edited mstpaths.h to point to where the
kernel method definitions live.  If you have already configured using 
config.mst in the parent directory of this directory, you shouldn't have to 
reconfigure here.

Step 1: Find out where your X system is installed.  The implementation needs
        two include files from the X release.  You should be running some
	version of X11; I've used X11 R4 and succeeded.  Edit the Makefile
	and modify the definition of XINCLUDE to reflect this path.

Step 2: Compile the world.  To do this, type 

	    make

        the normal GNU Smalltalk compilation should take place.  In addition,
	a file called socket.c (which implements the low-level socket-based
	connectivity to the X server) will be compiled.

Step 3: Run the test system by typing:

	    mst -V t.st

	You should see the normal set of files being loaded.  CFuncs.st
	may take longer since it's loading in more of the system than
	in the default environment.  After CFuncs.st has been loaded and
	the binary image saved, t.st is loaded.  You will see several
	expressions being excecuted and then (if all goes well) a window
	should appear that will let you know that you're a winning person.
