Compilation and installation notes for tin - 06-12-92 
-----------------------------------------------------

Tin has been compiled on a wide range of Un*x machines with cc and gcc.
A list of these machines can be found at the end of this file.

This file is long (so was the yellow brick road) but please read it all
as it could save you problems later and we don't want an unhappy ending
do we? :-)  

Tin can be compiled to read news in any of the following ways:

  o  locally from your machines news spool dir (default /usr/spool/news).

  o  locally and remotely (rtin or tin -r option) (-DNNTP_ABLE).

  o  remotely from another machine via NNTP but creating tin index files
     on local machine for each user in $HOME/.tin/.index (-DNNTP_ONLY).

  o  remotely from another machine via NNTP and also retreiving tin index
     files from remote machine via NNTP (-DNNTP_ONLY). This
     option requires that MY NNTP XUSER & XINDEX patches be applied to
     your NNTP server nntpd. On the NNTP server the index daemon of tin
     'tind' needs to be run from cron to update the index files at 
     regular inetervals.

  o  locally from you machines news spool dir (defult /usr/spool/news)
     and via CD-ROM using pseudo NNTP library with XSPOOLDIR command.
     (-DCDROM_ABLE) must be defined and tin must be linked with the
     pseudo NNTP CD-ROM library libcllib.a.
 
  o  via CD-ROM only using pseudo NNTP library with XSPOOLDIR command.
     (-DCDROM_ONLY) must be defined and tin must be linked with the
     pseudo NNTP CD-ROM library libcllib.a.
 
The -DNNTP_ABLE or -DNNTP_ONLY define must be added to CFLAGS in 
Makefile and the correct libraries need to be linked to produce
an NNTP aware tin.

If -DCDROM_ABLE is defined tin will not work with normal NNTP. This
may change as the CD-ROM library is further developed.

Building Tin (Normal & Daemon versions) 
---------------------------------------

Normal version
1)  Type 'make' and a few system types will be displayed.
2)  Edit Makefile if you want to add/change -D<defines>.
3)  Type 'make <system type>' to compile for your system.
4)  Type 'make install' / 'make install_setuid' to install.

Note1: If you want to retreive tin index files from your NNTP server
      you will have to compile the tind index file daemon so do the
      following steps:

  1)  Build 'Normal version' of tin as specified by the above 4 points.
  2)  The tind index daemon needs to be installed on your NNTP server.
      More info. concerning my NNTP patches & the tin daemon can be 
      found in the INSTALL.NNTP file.  
  3)  Apply my NNTP XUSER & XINDEX patches to your nntpd server or this
      will not work!!!. (If you want tind locally read Note3).  
  4)  Edit the Makefile and add -DINDEX_DAEMON to your CFLAGS entry and
      remove any -DNNTP_* defines. Also remove any -lcurses screen type
      libs as tind does not need to be linked with curses and it will
      save a good 30-50K on the size of tind.
  5)  Type 'make <system type>' to compile tind daemon for your NNTP server.
  6)  Type 'make install_daemon' to install tind daemon on your NNTP server.
  7)  Add the following line to your system cron to run tind every 30 mins:
        00,30 * * * * su news -c '/usr/lib/news/tind'
        
  Note2: tind must be run as user 'news' and the normal tin must have 
         the correct permissions to read the central index files!
  Note3: tind can also be used to update a copy of all index files
         centrally so each user does not have duplicate files.
 
    
Compiler flags (-D<name> define directives)
-------------------------------------------
News directory structure
------------------------

LIBDIR
Define if news software is not in /usr/lib/news.

INEWSDIR
Define if bnews/cnews program 'inews' is not in LIBDIR.

SPOOLDIR
Define if news articles are not in /usr/spool/news.


Reading/posting news via NNTP
----------------------------- 

NNTP_ABLE
Define if you wish to read news locally and remotely via an NNTP server.

NNTP_ONLY
Define if you [want to | can] ONLY read news remotely via an NNTP server.

NNTP_INEWS
Define if you want to use my builtin NNTP POST routine so that you no
longer have to rely on the mini-inews from NNTP to be installed on each
client machine. Also check that NNTP_INEWS_GATEWAY & NNTP_INEWS_DOMAIN 
are correctly set to produce correct From: headers for your site.

DONT_HAVE_NNTP_EXTS
Define if you have a *virgin* NNTP server without my patches. This is just
a nicety that will stop tin asking the server if it supports my NNTP server
extensions XINDEX, XMOTD, XUSER & SPOOLDIR (cdrom) extensions.

NNTP_INEWS_GATEWAY
Defines the name of your news gateway machine. Useful if you don't want 
your internal network visable to the outside world.
Example: I use this define to make all my net postings appear from our news
gateway machine 'anl433' even though I post from my own workstation 'sony01'
ie. -DNNTP_INEWS_GATEWAY=\"anl433\"
If the first letter of the string is a '/' the gateway name will be read from 
the specified file.
If the first letter of the string is a '$' the gateway name will be read from 
the specified environment variable. The env. variable contents may be a path.
If the first letter of the string is a '%' the gateway name will be directly
appended to the username 
ie. -DNNTP_INEWS_GATEWAY=\"%anl433.uucp@Germany.EU.net\" will create the net 
address Iain.Lea%anl433.uucp@Germany.EU.net
The '%' hack will *only* be used if NNTP_INEWS_DOMAIN is not defined.

NNTP_INEWS_DOMAIN
Defines the name of your network domain. 
Example: I use this define to add our uucp domain '.uucp' to our news 
gateways machine address 'anl433.uucp'.
ie. -DNNTP_INEWS_DOMAIN=\".uucp\"
If the first letter of the string is '/' the domain name will be read from 
the specified file.
If the first letter of the string is a '$' the domain name will be read from 
the specified environment variable. The env. variable contents may be a path.

NNTP_SERVER_FILE
Only define if your nntpserver file is other than /etc/nntpserver.

NETLIBS
Contains the networking libraries needed to link with clientlib.o file.


Reading news via CD-ROM
-----------------------

CDROM_ABLE
Define if you wish to read news locally and from CD-ROM.

CDROM_ONLY
Define if you [want to | can] ONLY read news from CD-ROM.


Daemon options
--------------

INDEX_DAEMON
Define to make an index file updating daemon version of tin. Note that
no -lcurses or screen libraries need to be linked with tin when this
#define is specified. If defined this will automatically undefine all
NNTP_* defines as the daemon has to be installed on the NNTP server.


Miscellaneous options
---------------------

DEBUG
Define if you want tin to log debug info. to files in /tmp. Activated
by tin -Dn where n is 1 for NNTP only debug logging and n is 2 for 
logging all debug info. Debug files written to /tmp are ARTS, ACTIVE,
BASE and NNTP.

DONT_HAVE_MKDIR
Define if your machine does not have the mkdir() system call.

DONT_HAVE_GETCWD
Define if you don't have the getcwd() system call. getwd() will be used.

DONT_HAVE_SELECT
Define if you don't have the select() system call that is required to 
abort the indexing of a group in art.c.

DONT_LOG_USER
Log username & info to /tmp/.tin_log for usage statistics. If reading via
NNTP the NNTP XUSER extended command will log user info to NNTP server.
If -DNNTP_XUSER is defined it will define LOG_USER automatically.

DONT_REREAD_ACTIVE_FILE
Define if you do not want the active file to be reread periodically.
The reread period can be set in seconds by setting the tinrc variable
'reread_active_file_secs='

HAVE_ISPELL
Define if you have ispell (interactive spellchecker) installed and want the
option of checking your articles, mails before posting/mailing them.

HAVE_LONG_FILENAMES
Define if your machines filesystem supports filenames longer than 14
chars (default for BSD type systems).

HAVE_MAIL_HANDLER
Define if you want to use the MH style mail handling & reading code in mail.c
It should be noted that mail handling is not well tested and not yet fully
implemented. You can expect errors if you use this define so let me know the
problems by sending me a bug report ('B' bug command from within tin).

HAVE_MMDF_MAILER
Define if your machine uses a MMDF type mailer instead of sendmail.
It is defined as default on SCO Unix machines. It can be dynamically 
changed by setting the tinrc variable save_to_mmdf_mailbox to ON. 

HAVE_POSIX_JC
Define if your machine uses Posix style sigaction() signal handling.

HAVE_SETREUID
Define if problems occur when runnung tin as setuid news. Only define if
your system supports the setreuid() system call.

NO_PIPING
Do not allow piping of articles to shell commands.

NO_POSTING
Do not allow posting/followup of articles.

NO_REGEX
Define if you do not want to use regular expression pattern matching.

NO_SHELL_ESCAPE
Do not allow shell escapes.

SLOW_SCREEN_UPDATE
Define if running over a low speed connection (ie. 2400baud). It stops
the percentage info being shown at bottom of select and group menus and
stops the groupname being displayed at the bottom of the screen as it is
subscribed/unsubscribed.

SMALL_MEMORY_MACHINE
Define if you are running a machine with little memory (<4MB). Tin will
run slightly slower but be more efficent in how memory is allocated and
reclaimed.
 
USE_CLEARSCREEN
Define if the you wish screen to use ClearScreen() and not MoveCursor()
and CleartoEOLN(). This is perhaps faster on slow terminals but I have
not really run any speed tests recently.

USE_INVERSE_HACK
Define if you want inverse video and highlighted bar disabled. Can be 
toggled in tin by the 'I' command and highlight bar by 'M' command.
