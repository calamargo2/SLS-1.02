2)  Iain Lea (Iain.Lea%anl433.uucp@Germany.EU.net)

    FIX. misc.c - added unlink() to delete ~/.tin/newsgroups file.

5)  Tommy Hsieh (tommy@Eng.Sun.COM)
    BUG. Whenever uudecode is used to decode a file it will generate a 
         <defunct> process.
    FIX. post.c save.c - applied supplied patch.

6)  Dwarven Knight (rcv@ukc.ac.uk)
    BUG. It seemed that tin was ALWAYS creating and using the default 
         values for the save and mail dirs.
    FIX. init.c - applied supplied patch.

7)  Iain Lea (Iain.Lea%anl433.uucp@Germany.EU.net)
    BUG. 'K' mark thread read skips over arts that have been marked unread
         at page level.
    FIX. group.c - added check for next unread or art that will return.

8)  Iain Lea (Iain.Lea%anl433.uucp@Germany.EU.net)
    BUG. When following upto an article I always have to delete the prefix 
         char on a blnk line before answering a paragraph.
    FIX. misc.c - added check so that if 1st char is LF don't add prefix 
         char to line.

9)  Iain Lea (Iain.Lea%anl433.uucp@Germany.EU.net)
    BUG. 'z' command to mark group as unread is broken.
    FIX. select.c - added read_newsrc() call to reread .newsrc for group.

10) Rob Engle (engle@cdc.hp.com)
    BUG. The new "xindex" extension overloads the meaning of the command
         without returning a code that tells the program whether it got an
         ".overview" file or a TIN index file.  I think it would make more
         sense to use a separate command so that readers that understand 
         only the ".overview" format would use the "xoverview" command.
    FIX. xoverview.c - created XOVERVIEW NNTP extension for .overview
         style index files.

11) Jose Miguel Femenia Herrero (femenia@graf.ci.uv.es)
    BUG. fd_set variable undefined on compiling AIX on RS6000.
    FIX. config.h tin.h - applied supplied patch.

12) Iain Lea (Iain.Lea%anl433.uucp@Germany.EU.net)
    BUG. Tagging arts uses 'T' when 't' would be easier. 't' goto top level
         therefore requires remapping both commands. 't' also means that
         tag command would be the same in tin & elm.
    FIX. page.c - swapped the meaning of the 't' & 'T' commands.

13) Iain Lea (Iain.Lea%anl433.uucp@Germany.EU.net)
    BUG. Not as easy to use as elm the 1st time because tin does not a 
         mini menu of useful commands to get the 1st time user started.
    FIX. added show_min_help() routine to show new user useful commands.

14) Ted Richards (ted@isgtec.com)
    BUG. Ispell option should be offered when mailing article.
    FIX. post.c - added ispell routine to mail_to_someone().

15) Ted Richards (ted@isgtec.com)
    BUG. Saving articles with $~=+ chars does not work.
    FIX. misc.c save.c - applied supplied patch.

16) Iain Lea (Iain.Lea%anl433.uucp@Germany.EU.net)
    ADD. 'H' command at all levels to toggle the display of the elm like
         mini menus of the most useful commands for 1st time users.

17) Earle Ake (ake@dayton.saic.com)
    BUG. Utilities (ie. maildir, vi, etc.) have different dirs on BSDI/386.
    FIX. tin.h - applied supplied patch.

18) Mark Tomlinson (mark@garden.equinox.gen.nz)

    FIX. select.c - changed set_groupname_len() to only shorten groupnames
         if newsgroups descriptions are being displayed as well.

21) Iain Lea (Iain.Lea%anl433.uucp@Germany.EU.net)
    ADD. select.c -a added 'd' command to toggle group & group descriptions.

22) Iain Lea (Iain.Lea%anl433.uucp@Germany.EU.net)

    FIX. spooldir.c - 1 off error in dynamic resizing of spooldir array.

23) Norm Yamane (yamane@rss21.di.nrc.ca)
    BUG. When nfs mounting tin each system may have a different domain name 
         I would like to set up the domain name as an environment variable.
    FIX. inews.c - added check to see if NNTP_INEWS_DOMAIN/GATEWAY define 
         has '$' as 1st character. If so read domain/gateway from shell
         variable. ie. -DNNTP_INEWS_DOMAIN=\"$NNTP_NEWS_DOMAIN\"
