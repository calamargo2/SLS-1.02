       _T_i_n  is a full-screen easy to use threaded Netnews reader. It can
       read news locally (i.e. _/_u_s_r_/_s_p_o_o_l_/_n_e_w_s) or remotely (_r_t_i_n or _t_i_n
       _-_r  option)  via a NNTP (Network News Transport Protocol) server.
       _C_d_t_i_n can read news locally and  news  archived  on  CD-ROM.  The
       manipulation of MH style mail folders is also supported.

       _T_i_n has five separate levels of operation: Group selection level,
       Spooldir selection level, Group level, Thread level  and  Article
       level.  Use the 'h' (help) command to view a list of the commands
       available at a particular level.

       On startup _t_i_n will show  a  list  of  the  newsgroups  found  in
       _$_H_O_M_E_/_._n_e_w_s_r_c. An arrow '->' or highlighted bar will point to the
       first newsgroup. Move to a group by using the terminal arrow keys
       (terminal  dependent)  or  'j'  and 'k'.  Use PgUp/PgDn (terminal
       dependent) or  Ctrl-U  and  Ctrl-D  to  page  up/down.   Enter  a
       newsgroup by pressing RETURN.

       The  TAB  key advances to the next newsgroup with unread articles
       and enters it.

       --PP          purge  group  index  files of articles that no longer
                   exist. Care should be taken when using  this  command
                   as it stats each and every article in each group that
                   is accessed. On a low speed connection this can  have
                   an undisirable effect and it also knocks the hell out
                   of your filesystem.

       --rr          read news  remotely  from  the  default  NNTP  server
                   specified  in  the environment variable NNTPSERVER or
                   contained in the file _/_e_t_c_/_n_n_t_p_s_e_r_v_e_r.

       --RR          read news saved by -S option (not yet implemented).

       --ss _d_i_r      save articles to directory.  Default is _$_H_O_M_E_/_N_e_w_s.

       --SS          save unread articles for later reading by -R  option.
                   For  more  information read section Automatic Mailing
                   and Saving New News.

       --uu          create/update  index  files  for   every   group   in
                   _$_H_O_M_E_/_._n_e_w_s_r_c  or  file specified by -f option.  This
                   option is disabled if _t_i_n retreives its  index  files
                   via a NNTP server.

       --UU          start  _t_i_n  in  the  background to update index files
                   while reading news in the foreground.  This option is
                   disabled  if _t_i_n retreives its index files via a NNTP
                   server.

       --vv          verbose mode for -c -M -S -u and -Z options.

       --ww          quick mode to post an article and then exit.

       --zz          only start _t_i_n if there is any new/unread  news.   If
                   there is news _t_i_n will position cursor at first group
                   with unread news. Useful for putting in login file.

       --ZZ          check if there is any new/unread news and  exit  with
                   appropriate  status.   If  -v option is specified the
                   number of unread articles in each group  is  printed.
                   An  exit  code  0  indicates no news, 1 that an error
                   occurred and 2 that new/unread news  exists.   Useful
                   for writing scripts.

       _T_i_n  can  also  dynamically  change  its  options by the 'M' menu
       command.  Any changes are written to _$_H_O_M_E_/_._t_i_n_/_t_i_n_r_c.

       The index daemon version, _t_i_n_d, only supports the -f, -h, -I  and
       -v options.

       In  order  to  keep  track of threads, _t_i_n maintains an index for
       each newsgroup. There are a number  of  methods  in  which  index
       files can be created and updated.



                             Version 1.1 PL8                           2





TIN(1)                            LOCAL                           TIN(1)


       The  simplest  method is that each user creates/updates there own
       index files that are stored in _$_H_O_M_E_/_._t_i_n_/_._i_n_d_e_x.  This  has  the
       advantage  that  any  user  can  compile and install _t_i_n, but the
       disadvantage is that each user is going to be creating  duplicate
       files  and  using  precious disk space.  A good way to keep index
       files updated is by doing a _t_i_n _-_U that will update  index  files
       in  the  background while you are reading news in the foreground.
       You can also update index files via the system batcher cron  with
       the -u option:
              3300 66 ** ** ** //uussrr//llooccaall//bbiinn//ttiinn --uu

       A  slightly  better method is to set _t_i_n setuid news and have all
       index files created and updated in the news spool directory (i.e.
       _/_u_s_r_/_s_p_o_o_l_/_n_e_w_s_/_._i_n_d_e_x).  This  has the advantage that there will
       only be one copy of the index  files  on  each  machine  on  your
       network,  but  the disadvantage is that you will have _t_i_n running
       setuid news.

       A better method is to install the _t_i_n_d index file updating daemon
       and  have it create and update index files for all groups in your
       active file at regular intervals  in  the  news  spool  directory
       (i.e.  _/_u_s_r_/_s_p_o_o_l_/_n_e_w_s_/_._i_n_d_e_x). This has the advantage that there
       will only be one copy of the index files on each machine on  your
       network  and _t_i_n must not be setuid news, but the disadvantage is
       that you will have to have news permissions to install  _t_i_n_d  and
       root  permissions  to install an entry in the cron batcher system
       to have _t_i_n_d regularly update index files.

       The best method is to install the _t_i_n_d index file updating daemon
       on your NNTP server and have it create and update index files for
       all groups in your active file at regular intervals in  the  news
       spool  directory  (i.e.  _/_u_s_r_/_s_p_o_o_l_/_n_e_w_s_/_._i_n_d_e_x).   This  has the
       advantage that there will only be one copy of the index files  on
       the   NNTP  server  for  the  whole  of  your  network,  but  the
       disadvantage is that you will have  to  install  my  NNTP  server
       patches to allow _t_i_n to retreive index file from your NNTP server
       and and you must install an entry in the cron batcher  system  to
       have  _t_i_n_d  regularly  update  index files (note that this is the
       method we use on our network of 40-50 machines and have  not  had
       any problems).

       Entering  a  group  the  first  time tends to be slow because the
       index file must be built from  scratch  unless  the  _t_i_n_d  update
       daemon  is  being  used.  To  alleviate the slowness start _t_i_n to
       create all index files for the groups you subscribe to  with  _t_i_n
       _-_u  _-_v  and  go for a coffee. Subsequent readings of a group will
       cause incremental updating of the index file.

       If  reading  news  remotely  and  locally  updating  index  files
       operation  will  be  somewhat slower because the articles must be
       retreived from the NNTP server.

       time  consuming  job  as I discovered when I was given the job of
       maintaining our news system and news users.

       _T_i_n is a News User Agent and so most of  the  users  were  always
       asking  questions  or  doing things that could be frowned upon by
       there departments.  To releive news admins (and especially me) of
       this  features  have  been  added  to  make  life easier for news
       adminstrators.

       When a user starts _t_i_n it is  possible  to  inform  them  of  any
       important  changes/information  concerning  the  news  system  by
       displaying a message of the day (motd) file. The motd file should
       be  created  in your news lib directory (i.e. _/_u_s_r_/_l_i_b_/_n_e_w_s_/_m_o_t_d)
       and should have file permissions set to 0644.  The motd file will
       only be displayed if its contents is newer than the last time the
       user started _t_i_n. If reading news via NNTP my  XMOTD  patch  will
       have to have been applied to your NNTP server.

       A  user  starting  _t_i_n  for  the  first time can be automatically
       subscribed to a list of newsgroups that are deemed appropriate by
       the  news  administrator.  At our site the subscriptions file has
       125 groups (our active file contains over 400  groups  with  many
       only   being   marginally   interesting  to  most  people).   The
       subscriptions file should be created in your news  lib  directory
       (i.e.    _/_u_s_r_/_l_i_b_/_n_e_w_s_/_s_u_b_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n_s)   and   should   have  file
       permissions set to  0644.  If  reading  news  via  NNTP  my  LIST
       SUBSCRIPTIONS  patch  will have to have been applied to your NNTP
       server.

       If my NNTP XUSER patch has been applied to your NNTP  server  you
       will be able to log the username and machine to your NNTP logfile
       for usage statistics.

       _T_i_n has five separate levels of operation: Group selection level,

       At the Group Selection level the title  displays  the  number  of
       subscribed  groups.   The newsgroups are displayed on the left of
       the screen with the number of unread articles  displayed  on  the
       same line in the middle of the screen.

       At  the Group level the title contains the name of the group, the
       number of conversation threads and total number of articles i.e.,
       alt.sources  (7  23).   If the group has been setup not to thread
       articles (i.e.,  alt.sources  is  in  _$_(_H_O_M_E_)_/_._t_i_n_/_u_n_t_h_r_e_a_d)  the
       title will be alt.sources (U 23).  There are two possible display
       formats as shown below:

       before the attributes are specified for that group.

       All attributes are set to a reasonable default so you  only  have
       to specify the attribute that you want to change (i.e., savedir).

       All toggle attributes are set by specifying ON/OFF.

       The show_author attribute is  specified  by  a  number  from  the
       following range: 0=none, 1=username, 2=network address, 3=both.

       The  sort_art_type  attribute  is  specified by a number from the

       This  menu  is  accessed  by  pressing '^K' at the group and page
       levels.  It allows the user to kill or  select  an  article  that
       matches the current ``Subject:'' line, ``From:'' line or a string
       entered by the user.  The user entered string can be  applied  to
       the  ``Subject:''  or  ``From:''  lines  of an article.  The kill
       description can be limited to the current  newsgroup  or  it  can
       apply  to  all  newsgroups.  Once  entered the user can abort the
       command and not save the kill description, edit the kill file  or
       save the kill description.

       On starting _t_i_n the users killfile _$_H_O_M_E_/_._t_i_n_/_k_i_l_l is read and on
       entering a newsgroup any kill or select descriptions are applied.

       Articles  that match a kill description are marked killed and are
       not displayed. Articles that match an auto-select description are
       marked with a ''*'' when displayed.

       _T_i_n  allows  posting  of  articles,  follow-up  to already posted
       articles and replying direct through mail to  the  author  of  an
       article.

       Use  the  'w'  command  to post an article to a newsgroup.  After
       entering the post subject the default editor  (i.e.  vi)  or  the
       editor  specified  by  the  $VISUAL  environment variable will be
       started and the article can be entered.   To  crosspost  articles
       simply add a comma and the name of the newsgroup(s) to the end of
       the ``Newsgroups:'' line at the beginning of the article.   After
       saving and exiting the editor you are asked if you wish to a)bort
       posting the article, e)dit the article again or p)ost the article
       to the specified newsgroup(s).

       Use the 'W' command to display a history of the articles you have
       posted.  The date the article was posted,  which  newsgroups  the
       article   was  posted  to  and  the  articles  subject  line  are
       displayed.

       Use the 'f' / 'F' command to  post  a  follow-up  article  to  an
       already  posted  article.   The 'f' command will copy the text of
       the original article into the editor.  The editing  procedure  is
       the same as when posting an article with the 'w' command.

       Use  the  'r'  /  'R' command to reply direct through mail to the
       author of an already posted article.  The 'r' command  will  copy
       the  text  of  the original article into the editor.  The editing
       procedure is the same as when posting an  article  with  the  'w'
       command.   After  saving  and exiting the editor you are asked if
       you wish to a)bort sending the article, e)dit the  article  again
       or s)end the article to the author.

       The command interface to mail ('m'),  pipe  ('|'),  print  ('o'),
       crosspost  ('x')  and save ('s') articles is the same for ease of
       use.

       The initial command  will  ask  you  to  select  which  a)rticle,
       t)hread,  h)ot  (auto  selected) r)egex pattern, t)agged articles
       you wish to mail, pipe etc.

       Tagged articles must  have  already  been  tagged  with  the  'T'
       command.   All  tagged  articles can be untagged by the 'U' untag
       command.

       If regex pattern matching is selected you are asked  to  enter  a
       regular  expression  (i.e.  to  match  all articles subject lines
       containing 'net News' you must enter '*net News*').  Any articles
       that match the entered expression will be mailed, piped etc.

       To  save  articles  to  a  mailbox  with  the name of the current
       newsgroup (i.e. Alt.sources) enter '=' or '=<mailbox name>'  when
       asked for the save filename.

       To  save  articles  in  <newsgroup  name>/<filename> format enter
       '+<filename>'.

       When saving articles you can  specify  whether  the  saved  files
       should  be  post  processed  (i.e. unshar shell archive, uudecode
       multiple parts etc).  A default process type can be  set  by  the
       'Process type:' in the 'M' options menu.

       will be mailed a report of which articles were mailed/saved  from
       which  newsgroups  and the total number of articles mailed/saved.
       Articles are  saved  in  a  private  news  structure  under  your
       <savedir> directory (default is _$_H_O_M_E_/_N_e_w_s).  Be careful of using
       this option if you  read  a  lot  of  groups  because  you  could
       overflow  your filesystem.  If you only want to save a few groups
       it would be best to backup your full _$_H_O_M_E_/_._n_e_w_s_r_c and  create  a
       new  one that only contains the newsgroups you want to mail/save.
       Saved news can be read later by _t_i_n _-_R.

       _T_i_n will recognize a  signature  in  either  _$_H_O_M_E_/_._s_i_g_n_a_t_u_r_e  or
       _$_H_O_M_E_/_._S_i_g.   If _$_H_O_M_E_/_._s_i_g_n_a_t_u_r_e exists, then the signature will
       be pulled into the editor for  mail  commands.   A  signature  in
       _$_H_O_M_E_/_._s_i_g_n_a_t_u_r_e  will  not be pulled into the editor for posting
       commands since _i_n_e_w_s will append the signature itself.

       A signature in _$_H_O_M_E_/_._S_i_g will be pulled into the editor for both
       posting and mailing commands.

       The following is an example of a _$_H_O_M_E_/_._S_i_g file:

       _T_i_n  also  has  the capability to generate random signatures on a
       per newsgroup basis if so desired. The way to accomplish this  is
       to  specify  the default signature or the group attribute sigfile
       as  a  directory.   If  for   example   the   sigfile   path   is
       _/_u_s_r_/_i_a_i_n_/_._s_i_g_s  and  _._s_i_g_s is a directory then _t_i_n will select a
       random signature from any file that is  in  the  directory  _._s_i_g_s
       (note:  one  signature per numbered file). A random signature can
       also consist of a fixed part  signature  that  can  contain  your
       name,  address etc. followed by the random sig. The fixed part of
       the random sig is read from the file _$_H_O_M_E_/_._s_i_g_f_i_x_e_d.

              Set  the  article header field ``Reply-To:'' to the return
              address specified by the variable.  This is useful if  the
              machine  is not registered in the UUCP mail maps or if you
              wish to receive replies  at  a  different  machine.   This
              variable  has  precedence over the file _$_H_O_M_E_/_._t_i_n_/_r_e_p_l_y_t_o
              that may also contain a return address.

              This can contain  an  address  to  append  to  the  return
              address  when  replying  directly through mail to somebody
              whose mail address is not directly recognized by the local
              host.   For example say the return address is _u_s_e_r_@_b_i_g_v_a_x,
              but _b_i_g_v_a_x is not recognized by your  host,  so  therefore
              the  mail  will  not reach _u_s_e_r.  But the host _l_i_t_t_e_v_a_x is
              known to recognize your host and _b_i_g_v_a_x, so if ADD_ADDRESS
              is  set  (i.e.  'setenv  ADD_ADDRESS @littevax' for csh or
              'set ADD_ADDRESS @littevax' and 'export  ADD_ADDRESS'  for
              sh) the address _u_s_e_r_@_b_i_g_v_a_x_@_l_i_t_t_l_e_v_a_x will be used and the
              mail will reach _u_s_e_r_@_b_i_g_v_a_x.  This variable has precedence
              over the file _$_H_O_M_E_/_._t_i_n_/_a_d_d___a_d_d_r_e_s_s that may also contain
