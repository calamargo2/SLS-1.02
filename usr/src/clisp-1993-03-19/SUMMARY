   CLISP is a Common Lisp (CLtL1) implementation by Bruno Haible of
   Karlsruhe University and Michael Stoll of Munich University, both in
   Germany. It runs on microcomputers (Atari ST, Amiga 500-2000, DOS,
   OS/2) as well as on Unix workstations (Linux, Sun4, Sun386, HP9000/800
   and others) and needs only 1.5 MB of RAM, only 1 MB on Atari ST.  It
   is free software and may be distributed under the terms of GNU GPL.
   German and English versions are available, French coming soon.  CLISP
   includes an interpreter, a compiler and, for some machines, a screen
   editor. Packages running in CLISP include PCL and, on Unix machines,
   CLX.  Available by anonymous ftp from ma2s2.mathematik.uni-karlsruhe.de
   [129.13.115.2] in the directory /pub/lisp/clisp. For more information,
