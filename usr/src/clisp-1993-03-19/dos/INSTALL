Installation on DOS:
--------------------

1. Get and install EMX.
   EMX is Eberhard Mattes' Unix emulation for DOS and OS/2. You can it
   by anonymous ftp from rusmv1.rus.uni-stuttgart.de or ftp.hobbes.nmsu.edu.
   You will need EMX 0.8d or newer, preferrably EMX 0.8f or newer.

2. Make sure that \EMX\BIN is in your path, before any directory that
   contains programs named CPP.EXE or AS.EXE. Set the environment variables
   C_INCLUDE_PATH and LIBRARY_PATH. For example:

         PATH=C:\EMX\BIN;%PATH%
         SET C_INCLUDE_PATH=c:/emx/include
         SET LIBRARY_PATH=c:/emx/lib

   This must be done before executing ANY executable produced by EMX
   except LISP.EXE which will be created in a special way.

   Also install a `working' MAKE.EXE, e.g. GNU make. If you have problems
   with "make", try "make -n > h.bat" and then executing "h".

3. Choose a directory for Clisp, say \CLISP.

         CD \CLISP

   Unpack the sources in this directory:

         PKUNZIP -d CLISP.ZIP
   or
         TAR xvf CLISP.TAR

4. Convert the sources to the IBM PC character set.
   They are distributed in ISO Latin-1 character set.

         cd dos
         gcc -O cv_lt_pc.c -o cv_lt_pc.exe
         cv_lt_pc < convert.bax > convert.bat
         convert.bat
         cd ..

   Copy some DOS specific files into SRC:

         DOS\COPYX.BAT

   You may then delete unnecessary files:

         DOS\DELX.BAT

5. Go to directory

         cd src

6. Build the readline library:

         cd readline
         make
         cd ..

7. Type

         make config.lsp

   and edit the contents of config.lsp appropriately for your site,
   especially the definitions of short-site-name and long-site-name.

   You may also choose to build the german version of CLISP by adding
   -DDEUTSCH to the line defining CFLAGS in the makefile.

8. Type

         make

   to build CLISP.
   You may alternatively do this in six steps:
         make init                prepares all symbolic links and utilities
         make allc                makes all *.c files
         make lisp.exe            makes the executable
         make interpreted.mem     a memory image with everything uncompiled
         make compiled.mem        makes all *.fas files and
                                  a memory image with everything compiled
         make manual              makes the documentation
   The fifth step is the most time consuming: it takes about an hour on a
   486/33 and may take several hours on a slower machine.

9. Make a directory for a lasting installation of CLISP, say D:\LIB\LISP.
   Copy lisp.exe and compiled.mem there:

         copy lisp.exe D:\LIB\LISP\lisp.exe
         copy compiled.mem D:\LIB\LISP\lispinit.mem

   Make a batch file for CLISP in a directory belonging to your PATH:

         copy con D:\BAT\CLISP.BAT
         D:\LIB\LISP\lisp.exe -M D:\LIB\LISP\lispinit.mem %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9
         [Ctrl-Z]

   Don't forget the documentation:

         copy ..\DOS\CLISP.* D:\LIB\LISP
         copy ..\DOS\IMPNOTES.TXT D:\LIB\LISP

   You can now remove directory \CLISP and all its contents.

10.If you find CLISP fast and bug-free and you like using it, a gift of $25
   (or any amount you like) will be appreciated. If not, feel free to send
   us suggestions for improvement.
