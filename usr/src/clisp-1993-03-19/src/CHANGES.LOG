19 March 1993
=============

User visible changes
--------------------

* Replaced variable *TEMPFILE* by a function EDITOR-TEMPFILE.

Portability
-----------

* Unix version: Corrected detection of ANSI C header files.

* Unix version: Check whether signal handlers are automatically reinstalled
  when activated.

* Made readline library ANSI C compliant and (on Unix) auto-configuring.

* In case there is no room for three extra bits in a symbol pointer,
  allocate three stack words per binding in a VAR frame (instead of two stack
  words). This completes the Amiga 3000/4000 version.

* Completed memory model SPVW_PURE_BLOCKS: There is a large contiguous memory
  area for each kind of Lisp object. This model is used only if memory can
  be allocated at prescribed addresses, for example on Unix with mmap().

* More 386BSD support.

Other modifications
-------------------

* Remove limit on the number of files that may be specified on the command
  line. Limit was 1000.

* Miscellaneous documentation updates.


4 March 1993
============

User visible changes
--------------------

* Fixed a bug in ADJOIN that caused ADJOJN and PUSHNEW to push (key item)
  instead of item onto the list when a :KEY argument was present.

* Amiga version: allow opening of "files" on special devices.

* OS/2 version: Long filenames on DOS (FAT) filesystems no longer produce
  errors. They are now silently truncated to 8+3 characters.

* Unix, Amiga, OS/2 versions: When a pathname is to be fully specified, no
  subdirectory wildcard "**/" or ".../" is allowed. Check this.

Portability
-----------

* Corrected underflow detection in SCALE-FLOAT on 16-bit processors.

* Atari ST version: fixed getenv(), wrote INSTALL instructions.

Other modifications
-------------------

* Miscellaneous documentation updates.


21 February 1993
================

User visible changes
--------------------

* Include test suite into distribution.

* Add COMMON-LISP and CLTL1 to the *FEATURES*.

* Fixed a bug in the compiler which caused the compiler to crash in some
  rare cases.

* Fixed a bug in WITH-OPEN-FILE: handle the case when OPEN returns NIL.

* Amiga version: Fixed bug in FILE-POSITION.

* Amiga version: Renamed REXX-WAIT-COMMAND to REXX-WAIT-SENT-COMMAND.

Portability
-----------

* On HP-UX: Use /bin/ksh for shell scripts instead of the buggy /bin/sh.

* Now compiles on IRIX using CC="cc -ansi".

* Added 386BSD support.

Other modifications
-------------------

* Miscellaneous documentation updates.


3 February 1993
===============

Portability
-----------

* Support for 386 UHC UNIX System V release 4 now works.

Other modifications
-------------------

* lispbibl.d: Rename macro `untype' to `upointer', `type_untype_object' to
  `type_pointer_object'.

* lispbibl.d: Clean up selection of type code and frame code tables.

* Remove init streams. Use string input streams instead.


1 February 1993
===============

User visible changes
--------------------

* Fixed handling of declarations in macros DO-SYMBOLS, DO-EXTERNAL-SYMBOLS,
  DO-ALL-SYMBOLS, DOSEQ, DOHASH.

* LISTEN on file streams opened with :DIRECTION :OUTPUT now returns NIL.

* Pathnames resulting from OPEN on special files are now called
  "file handle streams", they are unbuffered file streams.
  They can now be used as argument in situations where a pathname is expected.

Portability
-----------

* The `target' and `configure' scripts no longer depend on awk.

* Support Sun4 with 32 bit address range (kernel architecture "Sun4m") as
  well as Sun4 with 29 bit address range (kernel architecture "Sun4", "Sun4c).

* Can now exploit the shared memory facilities of SunOS 4.1 and of Linux.

* Added support for 386 UHC UNIX System V release 4.

Other modifications
-------------------

* Implemented memory model SPVW_PURE_PAGES where memory is divided
  into many small pages each containing objects of the same type.

* Fixed up source for systems without window streams.

* lispbibl.d, constobj.d: reorder the stream types such that the test for
  file stream becomes faster.

* /usr/local/lib/aclocal.m4, configure.in, unixconf.h.in: prefix my own local
  macros by CL_ instead of AC_.

* Miscellaneous documentation updates.


11 January 1993
===============

User visible changes
--------------------

* Fixed meaning of :KEY argument for SUBLIS and NSUBLIS.

* DOS, OS/2 versions: adapted to emx 0.8f. This results in better
  *KEYBOARD-INPUT* on DOS and faster screen access on OS/2.

* Amiga version: implemented SHELL.

* OS/2 version: implemented MAKE-PIPE-INPUT-STREAM and MAKE-PIPE-OUTPUT-STREAM.

* compiler.lsp: Emit a warning when #'foo is used but foo is undefined.

* rexx.d, rexx.lsp: remove the trailing "p" from the keywords.

* init.lsp: don't call a macro a "Common Lisp function".

* stream.d, readline/readline.[ch]: exported rl_deprep_terminal such that a
  failing call to xmalloc() can now signal an ordinary error instead of exiting.

Portability
-----------

* Rewrote makemake.in using indentation.

* /usr/local/lib/aclocal.lsp: fixed AC_SYS_ERRLIST (m4 bug?) and AC_RENAME,
  improved AC_SELECT and added AC_SETITIMER.

* spvw.d: implement ualarm for Unix with interval timers, e.g. HP/UX or Linux.

* Remove support for Linux 0.12.

Other modifications
-------------------

* Language (DEUTSCH resp. ENGLISH) can now be set from CFLAGS, without
  modifying lispbibl.d.

* _README translated into german.

* Renamed clispsrc.1 to FILES.1.

* Renamed pseudofu.d to pseudofun.d.

* Sun4 version: merged il_sparc.il into cc_sparc.il.

* lispbibl.d: use an enum type to get the stream types converted
  to consecutive numbers without risking clashes.

* intgcd.d: found algorithm for binary extended gcd.

* intlog.d: make use of 80386 instruction "bsfl" where possible.

* lispbibl.d: let gcc2 on 680x0 emit "dbra" instructions.

* spvw.d: use IPC_PRIVATE as key for all shared memory segments.

* avl.d: don't generate code for unused functions insert and delete.

* Miscellaneous documentation updates.


1 January 1993
==============

Release of first portable version of CLISP.
It now compiles and runs under
* Atari ST
* Amiga 500-2000
* DOS
* OS/2 2.0
* Linux
* Sun4
* Sun386
* HP9000/800

Now that the tests passed, I hope I'll never again have to remove a serious
bug.
