Explanation of the installation step 2:
---------------------------------------

You will have to convert the sources from ISO Latin-1 to the Atari ST
character set.

Included here are programs for this conversion. Compile them:

    cc cv_lt_at.c -o cv_lt_at
    cc nl-to-crlf.c -o nl-to-crlf

Install them somewhere in your path:

    cp cv_lt_at nl-to-crlf to-atari all-to-atari /usr/local/bin

Included are also programs for conversion in the opposite direction.
Note that both conversions are not true inverses of each other since
there are characters present in one character set and not in the other.
Compile them:

    cc cv_at_lt.c -o cv_at_lt
    cc crlf-to-nl.c -o crlf-to-nl

Install them somewhere in your path:

    cp cv_at_lt crlf-to-nl from-atari all-from-atari /usr/local/bin

Now convert the sources:

    cd ..
    all-to-atari src/* utils/*
