The coversheet for a fax transmission is generated with a postscript
program which lives in the file ps/coversheet.ps. 

The coversheet.ps program is invoked by the C program also named
coversheet in the file coversheet/coversheet.c

The coversheet.ps file can be modified to suit your site. When run in
Ghostscript, it generates fields on the page for the recipient's name,
and your return fax number. The coversheet.c program passes these
arguments to the postscript program by setting the global variables

%   /returnfaxnum 
%   /sender
%   /recipient
%   /pages 

Look at the coversheet.ps file for details.
