			  Installing Netfax
			  -----------------


The makefiles for this system use the GNU make, which is a superset of
the vanilla unix make utility.  

The configuration files:

	include/conf.h
	include/conf.mk
	include/fax_prog.mk

should be edited for your local configuration, before building.

Ghostscript (2.41) now has direct support for imaging to G3 fax data
format.  We now use the digifax "dfaxhigh" device, to convert
postscript to G3 files.

In order to compile Ghostscript with the fax driver, add the digifax
drivers to the device-drivers line to the Ghostscript makefile, like
this:

	DEVICE_DEVS=x11.dev dfaxhigh.dev dfaxlow.dev

Please read the README file for more information.
