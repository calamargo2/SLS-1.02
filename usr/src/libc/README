You need to edit Makeconfig to reflect your configuration. You
can do

make STATIC=true	# for static library

make SHARED=true	# for shared image and stub libraries.

make LITE=true		# for light version shared library
			# no stub libraries are built.

make DEBUG=true		# for libg.a

make PROFILE=true	# for libc_p.a

make MATH=true		# for static libm.a only

make MATH=true SHARED=true	# for shared image and stub for libm.a

You can always add "I486=true" to get binaries for i486.

`verify.out.libc.so' is the difference between lib*.sa and
libc.so.4.x.y due to the backward compatibilty.

Thanks.
