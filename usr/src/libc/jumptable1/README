David,

libc.jump1 has the all the functions in libc.a. I have 5 more
functions. I added setfileno () and _cleanup (). There are also 4
g.data.lib* files. I checked all of them against the header files
with 'global.sh'. They can be used by any programs. I suggest we
move non constant global data from text section to data section and
fill the gap with your program. The result will look like

	section		content
----------------------------------
 	text		VERSION
			jumptable
			align to 16k (about 2000 entries)
			global data in text section
 			constants pointed to by global data in text
				section
			text in library
			fill the gap to 320k (we have at most 320k text
				in libc)
 	data		global data in data section



Linus suggests to put the shared image at 0x60000000 and above. I think
1 MB for libc.a and libm.a, 1 MB for libg++.a and 1 MB for X. The rest
can go from there. I heard InterView wanted 4.5 MB.

BTW, there is also a ChangeLog.
