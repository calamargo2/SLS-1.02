.SH "WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS"
.ta 4c
.LP
.nf
Name:	\fBdoubleBuffered\fR
Class:	\fBNone\fR
Command-Line Switch:	\fB\-doublebuffered or \-dbl\fR
.fi
.IP
Specifies that an off-screen pixmap should be used when displaying 
the graph.  This option slows the overall speed of redrawing the graph,
but reduces the flashing involved with many redraws. 
The argument must be a boolean value (see \fBTcl_GetBoolean\fR for further 
information). By the default, this option is \fBtrue\fR.
.LP
.nf
Name:	\fBlegendPosition\fR
Class:	\fBLegendPosition\fR
Command-Line Switch:	\fB\-legendposition\fR
.fi
.IP
Specifies the position of the legend in screen coordinates.  The position
given represents the upper left corner of the legend. The format of the
position is "@x,y", where x and y are the screen coordinates.  If the
position is the empty string, the legend will be displayed in the right 
margin (which is automatically extended to accomodate the legend).
The default position is the empty string.
.LP
.nf
Name:	\fBlegendBorderWidth\fR
Class:	\fBorderWidth\fR
Command-Line Switch:	\fB\-legendborderwidth or \-lbd\fR
.fi
.IP
Specifies a non-negative integer value indicating the width (in pixels)
of the 3-D border to draw around the outside of the legend (if such a
border is being drawn;  the \fBlegendrelief\fR option determines
this).  
.LP
.nf
Name:	\fBlegendRelief\fR
Class:	\fBRelief\fR
Command-Line Switch:	\fB\-legendrelief or \-lrelief\fR
.fi
.IP
Specifies the 3-D effect desired for the legend.  Acceptable
values are \fBraised\fR, \fBsunken\fR, and \fBflat\fR.  The value
indicates how the interior of the legend should appear relative
to the graph;  for example, \fBraised\fR means the legend 
should appear to protrude from the graph, relative to
the surface of the graph.
.LP
.nf
Name:	\fBlegendBackground\fR
Class:	\fBBackground\fR
Command-Line Switch:	\fB\-legendbackground or \-lbg\fR
.fi

.nf
Name:	\fBretrace\fR
Class:	\fBRetrace\fR
Command-Line Switch:	\fB\-retrace\fR
.fi
.IP
Specifies if retrace lines will be drawn when displaying the graph.
Typically, X coordinate values are presented in increasing order
and deviations (where the next x value is less) indicate a new 
line sequence.  If \fBtrue\fR, all values, regardless of order will 
represent a single line sequence. The argument specifies a boolean 
value (see \fBTcl_GetBoolean\fR for further information). The default value 
is \fBfalse\fR.

Command-Line Switch:	\fB\-showlegend\fR
.fi
.IP
Specifies if the legend will be shown when displaying the graph.
The argument specifies a boolean value (see \fBTcl_GetBoolean\fR 
for further information). The default value is \fBtrue\fR.
.LP
.nf
Name:	\fBtitle\fR
Class:	\fBTitle\fR
Command-Line Switch:	\fB\-title\fR
.fi
.IP
Specifies a string to be used as the title displaying the graph.
If the argument is an empty string, no title will be displayed.
.LP
.nf
Name:	\fBxLabel\fR
Class:	\fBLabel\fR
Command-Line Switch:	\fB\-xlabel\fR

for further information).  By default, the scale is linear.
.LP
.nf
Name:	\fBxMinimum\fR
Class:	\fBMinimum\fR
Command-Line Switch:	\fB\-xminimum\fR
.fi
.IP
Specifies the minimum of the range of the X coordinate values.
If the argument is the empty string, the minimum is determined from
the data of the lines to be displayed. 
.LP
.nf
Name:	\fBxMax\fR
Class:	\fBMaximum\fR
Command-Line Switch:	\fB\-xmaximum\fR
.fi
.IP

stepsize value is applied only when it makes sense, otherwise the 
stepsize is calculated based upon the extents of the data.  The two
cases where this can occur is when the stepsize is less than or equal to 
zero or it is greater than the range of values for the axis. By default, 
the stepsize is 0.0, and the axis stepsize is automatically calculated.
.LP
.nf
Name:	\fByLabel\fR
Class:	\fBLabel\fR
Command-Line Switch:	\fB\-ylabel\fR

.SH INTRODUCTION
.PP
The \fBxygraph\fR command creates a new window (given by the 
\fIpathName\fR argument) and makes it into a \fBxygraph\fR widget.
Additional
options, described above, may be specified on the command line
or in the option database
to configure aspects of the graph such as its colors and font.
The \fBxygraph\fR command returns its
\fIpathName\fR argument.  At the time this command is invoked,
there must not exist a window named \fIpathName\fR, but
\fIpathName\fR's parent must exist.
.PP
The \fBxygraph\fR widget plots two variable data with an optional legend
in a window.  
.PP
The xygraph is a widget that displays a collection of lines and tags
with X and Y axes and a legend.
Lines and tags are not distinct widgets; the entire graph is one widget.
Initially the \fBxygraph\fR widget has no lines or tags.
.SH "LINES"
A line is a set of values and configuration options which determine how the 
line is displayed.  Lines are created by the \fBinsert\fP widget command. 
The configuration options may be specified as the line is created or later 
by the \fBlineconfigure\fR widget command.  There is also an internal
list of line names which controls which lines are to be displayed.
By default, each new line is added to this list.  However, the \fBshow\fR
command allows the use to specify which lines are to be displayed.
The \fBnames\fR commands returns a list of all lines.
.PP
By default, the axis limits are configured to contain all the points 
of all lines to be displayed. The axis limits may be set by the 
\fBconfigure\fR command and only those points falling within the limits of 
both axes are displayed.
.br
.SH "TAGS"
A tag is a text string or bitmap displayed on the graph.
Tags are created by the \fBnewtag\fR widget command.  The coordinate
of the tag must be specified.  This coordinate is a x,y value of
the graph (not a screen coordinate).
Like lines, tags are draw only is their coordinates fall with the 
range of the axis limits.  Tags may also be rotated at right angles. 
Please note however, that since the tag is rotated each time the graph 
is displayed, it is much slower to rotate a tag from its default of 
zero degrees.
.PP
Tags can be used to annotate or highlight areas of the graph.
They may also be associated with a particular line, so that they are 
drawn only when the line is visible. Tags are the first items drawn 
when the graph is displayed, so that lines, symbols, legend, and 
axes always appear in front of them.  
.SH "WIDGET COMMANDS"
.PP
The \fBxygraph\fR command creates a new Tcl command whose
name is \fIpathName\fR.  This
command may be used to invoke various
operations on the widget.  It has the following general form:
.DS C
\fIpathName option \fR?\fIarg arg ...\fR?
.DE
\fIOption\fR and the \fIarg\fRs
determine the exact behavior of the command.  The following
commands are possible for \fBxygraph\fR widgets:
.TP
\fIpathName \fBconfigure\fR ?\fIoption\fR? ?\fIvalue option value ...\fR?
Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.
If no \fIoption\fR is specified, returns a list describing all of
the available options for \fIpathName\fR (see \fBTk_ConfigureInfo\fR for
information on the format of this list).  If \fIoption\fR is specified
with no \fIvalue\fR, then the command returns a list describing the
one named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding
sublist of the value returned if no \fIoption\fR is specified).  If
one or more \fIoption\-value\fR pairs are specified, then the command
modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);  in
this case the command returns an empty string.
\fIOption\fR may have any of the values accepted by the \fBxygraph\fR
command.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBdelete \fIlineName\fR
Delete the line named \fIlineName\fP from the graph. If the line
is currently displayed, the graph will be redrawn.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBinsert \fIlineName ?option value option value...?\fR
Create or replace a line named \fIlineName\fP in the \fBxygraph\fR widget.
By default, the line is added to the list of lines to be displayed.
If additional arguments are present, they specify any of the following
options:
.RS
.TP
\fB\-color \fIcolor\fR
Specifies the color of the line or symbol.
.TP
\fB\-linewidth \fIvalue\fR
Specifies the width of the line drawn. The default line width is 0.
.TP
\fB\-symbolsize \fIvalue\fR
Specifies the size of the symbol as a percentage of the plotting area.
By default the symbol size percentage is 1.15.
.TP
\fB\-symbol \fIsymbolName\fR
Specifies the symbol or line style to use for plotting line values. 
Valid symbols are \fBsquare\fR, \fBcircle\fR, \fBplus\fR, \fBdiamond\fR, 
\fBcross\fR, and \fBpoint\fR.  
Valid line styles are are \fBsolid\fR, \fBdashed\fR, and \fBdotted\fR.
The default is \fBsolid\fR.
.TP
\fB\-xdata \fIvalueList\fR
Specifies the y-coordinate values to plotted. The argument \fIvalueList\fR
is a list of real numbers and/or numeric expressions representing the
x-coordinates of the line.  
.TP
\fB\-xydata \fIvalueList\fR
Specifies the x and y values to plotted. The argument \fIvalueList\fR is
a list of real numbers and/or numeric expressions representing the 
coordinate pairs for each point of the line.
.TP
\fB\-ydata \fIvalueList\fR
Specifies the y-coordinate values to plotted. The argument \fIvalueList\fR
is a list of real numbers and/or numeric expressions representing the
y-coordinates of the line.  
.TP
\fB\-label \fIstring\fR
Specifies the label of the line as shown in the legend.  If the label is
the empty string, there will be no symbol entry displayed legend. By default, 
the label is the name of the line.
.RE
.TP
\fIpathName \fBlimits\fR
Returns a list containing the values representing the axis
limits.  The format of the list returned is \fBxmin xmax ymin ymax\fR.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBlineconfigure \fIlineName ?options?\fR
This command is similar to the \fBconfigure\fR command, except that
it applies to the options for an individual line, whereas \fBconfigure\fR
applies to the options for the graph as a whole.
\fIOptions\fR may have any of the values accepted by the \fBinsert\fR
widget command.  If \fIoptions\fR are specified, options are modified
as indicated in the command and the command returns an empty string.
If no \fIoptions\fR are specified, returns a list describing
the current options for entry \fIindex\fR (see \fBTk_ConfigureInfo\fR for
information on the format of this list).
.TP
\fIpathName \fBlocate \fIx y\fP 
Translate the given x and y screen coordinates to the corresponding 
graph values.  A list of the two translated values is returned.
If a given screen coordinate value does not represent a position 
over the graph, the value return will be either \fBInf\fR or \fB-Inf\fR.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBnames\fR
Return a list of the names of all lines in the widget.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBnewtag \fItagName x y ?option value option value...?\fR
Create or replace a tag named \fItagName\fP at the given \fIx\fR and \fIy\fR
coordinates in the \fBxygraph\fR widget.
If additional arguments are present, they specify any of the following
options:
.RS
.TP
\fB\-anchor \fIdirection\fR
Specifies how the information in a tag (e.g. text or a bitmap)
is to be displayed in the graph widget.
Must be one of the values \fBn\fR, \fBne\fR, \fBe\fR, \fBse\fR,
\fBs\fR, \fBsw\fR, \fBw\fR, \fBnw\fR, or \fBcenter\fR.
For example, \fBnw\fR means display the information such that its
top-left corner is at the top-left corner of the widget.
The default anchor is \fBcenter\fR.
.TP
\fB\-background \fIcolor\fR
Specifies the background color of the text string or bitmap when displaying
the tag.
.TP
\fB\-bitmap \fI@file\fR
Specifies the bitmap to use as the tag.
Specifies a bitmap to display in the widget, in any of the forms
acceptable to \fBTk_GetBitmap\fR.
The exact way in which the bitmap is displayed may be affected by
other options such as \fBanchor\fR or \fBrotation\fR.
If this option is specified then it overrides other
options that specify a textual value to display in the widget;
the \fBbitmap\fR option may be reset to an empty string to re-enable
a text display.
.TP
\fB\-font \fIfontName\fR
Specifies the font to use when drawing the tag inside the widget.
The default font is \fI"*-Helvetica-Bold-R-Normal-*-120-*"\fR.
.TP
\fB\-foreground \fIcolor\fR
Specifies the foreground color of the text string or bitmap when displaying
the tag.
.TP
\fB\-line \fIlineName\fR
Associates the tag with the line named \fIlineName\fR.  If \fIlineName\fR
is not the empty string, the tag is displayed only if a line \fIlineName\fR
exists and is being plotted.  This option may be used to annotate a
particular line.
.TP
\fB\-rotation \fIvalue\fR
Specifies the rotation of the tag. Currently, only right angle rotations 
are performed.  The default rotation is \fIfR.
.TP
\fB\-text \fIstring\fR
.IP
Specifies a string to be displayed as the tag.  The way in which
the string is displayed is determined by other options, 
such as \fBanchor\fR or \fBrotation\fR.
If \fIstring\fR is the empty string, the tag will not be displayed.
.RE
.TP
\fIpathName \fBpostscript \fIfileName\fR
Create a postscript file of the current plot. Returns an empty string.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBshow \fI?nameList?\fR
Reset the list of lines to be displayed.  Only those lines in found
in the list are plotted.  If no \fInameList\fP argument is present, a list of 
the currently visible lines is returned, otherwise returns an empty string.
.TP
\fIpathName \fBtagconfigure \fItagName ?options?\fR
This command is similar to the \fBconfigure\fR command, except that
it applies to the options for an individual tag, whereas \fBconfigure\fR
applies to the options for the graph as a whole.
\fIOptions\fR may have any of the values accepted by the \fBnewtag\fR
widget command.  If \fIoptions\fR are specified, options are modified
as indicated in the command and the command returns an empty string.
If no \fIoptions\fR are specified, returns a list describing
the current options for entry \fIindex\fR (see \fBTk_ConfigureInfo\fR for
information on the format of this list).
.TP
\fIpathName \fBuntag \fItagName\fR
Delete the tag named \fItagName\fP from the graph. 
.SH KEYWORDS
xygraph, widget

.SH BINDINGS
.PP
There are no default bindings. 

.SH BUGS
.PP
There is no way to change the drawing order. Currently the graph is
displayed drawing first the tags and then the legend, axes, and finally
the data (lines and/or symbols). For example, this means that there is no way 
to let the legend overlay the axes or data.
.PP
Rotated text is drawn using both the foreground and background (like
XDrawImageString).  This is because it is drawn as a pixmap.
.PP
The \fBpostscript\fR command fails to handle 1) bitmaps (tags), 
2) background colors for rotated text, and 3) differences between
the PS Adobe fonts and the X11 Adobe fonts.
.PP
Autoscale routines do not use requested min/max limits
as boundaries when the axis is logarithmically scale.  
.PP
Font sizes do not automatically scale with the size of the window.
.PP
The needs to be better log scale mapping for values >= 0.0. Possibly use
linear scale for numbers between 1..-1.
