PSCmenu 2.1

Changes Since 2.0:

	- The curses library is now used for better compatability (Even though
	  I hate how it works).
	- It now runs on SUN and HP-UX and most BSD systems
	- Some minor tweeks for smoother operation.

Install Notes for PSCmenu2.1

	This Menu system should compile on just about any machine.  I have
it working under Ultrix, AIX (IBM system V), SUN and HP-UX.  These are the 
only variations of UNIX that I know it has worked on.  If you have problems
just ask.  If you need to make changes to get menu to run on your system
please send me the following information:

	1. 	Computer Type.
	2.	Your variaton of UNIX. (Ultrix, AIX, SUN-OS, ...)
	3.	Code you had to modify.

To compile:

	unshar the shell archive via: % sh menu.shar
	
	then edit the header files "menu.h" & "dir.h" and the Makefile to set 
	appropriate paths for your system.
	
	Things to edit:

	dir.h: 	PRINT_PATH	- Set to path/name of file containg print
				  commands.
		PRT_TO_SCR	- Name of program that prints to screen.
	
	menu.h:	MENU_DIR	- The directory containing menu files.

	then
	
	do: % make

To Test:

	do: % ./menu ./demos

	This should show you a working example of how this menu
	works, the demo is set up for what this site is using so
	the applications called may not be on your system.


To install:

	do: % make install

Present & Future:

	At the present time menu has proved to be bug free, but there
is a possibility there are bugs.  Menu has been tested for 15 months
and has been used by hundreds of users successfully.  In the future
I plan to add the capability of combining menu file options.

	Example:

		+1	/bin/cat

	This would do both options '+' and '1'.
