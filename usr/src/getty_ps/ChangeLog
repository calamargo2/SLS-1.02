-------------------------
	completed getty 2.0.7 alpha
	(no public release)

Reported Problems with previous release:

	  an incompatibility with sysvinit.  flickering DTR with
	  uugetty.

Changes for this release:
	getty/uugetty:
	  totally reworked main.c, added uufuncs.c, main.h, uufuncs.h
	  in order to clean up the source code.  Added INITLINE so that
	  line initialization can be done over a separate device.
	  reincorporated support for the WAITFOR option.
	uugetty:
	  fork off a child to watch for lockfiles instead of using
	  alarm clocks, so that DTR is not disturbed (only if WAITFOR
	  is not used)

Plans for next release:
	getty/uugetty:
	  apply the ringback patches (by hand), and the various other
	  patches.
	Documentation:
	  move all of (4) to (5) to match the Linux manual scheme.
	  document INITLINE and ringback options in the man pages, README.
