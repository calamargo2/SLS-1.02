Changes for 0.4

	Throughput on the drive is still not that great (~100KB/sec).  I
	need to investigate why this is, but I suspect it has to do with
	buffering.  The drive is supposed to support 250KB/sec.

	Driver now supports multiple opens and arbitrates between multple
	pending operations.  Now you can have workman up and still mount
	a CDROM.

	The spin-waits used before the driver was initialized have been
	removed.  Now all operations are explicitly timed.

	The jiffies comparisons have been changed from '!=' to '<='.  I
	think jiffies counts were being missed sometimes.  Now the driver
	will fail if jiffies overflows, but that will only occur on multiples
	of about 24 days after the OS was booted, so I'm not too worried.

	The driver files were renamed cdu31a.  This was to avoid conflicts
	between it and other drives.
