and

       lisp.run and lispinit.mem   in  /usr/local/lib/lisp/

simply put the memory image in the same place:

   mv pcl.mem /usr/local/lib/lisp

and create a shell script that starts lisp:

   cat > /usr/local/bin/clos
   exec /usr/local/lib/lisp/lisp.run -M /usr/local/lib/lisp/pcl.mem -m 4MB "$@"
   [Ctrl-D]EOF
   chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/clos

Then try
