This directory contains GNU sed.

This sed may run slower than some UN*X seds.  This is because it uses
the regular-expression routines from Emacs, which are rather complete
and powerful, but not as fast as they could be.  If you really care
about speed, use perl instead.

See the file INSTALL for compilation and installation instructions.

Please report all bugs and comments to bug-gnu-utils@prep.ai.mit.edu.
