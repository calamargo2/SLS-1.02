This directory contains the MGR programmers manual.  The manual is made 
in two passes.  The first pass calculates the function index and category 
sections, then the second pass prints the document.

You might need to edit "macros" to change the definition of the fonts
used for 'Ff' and 'Fn' to whatever you call your constant width roman
and bold fonts.

You also may like to edit ROFFLAGS for another output device, e.g. -Tdvi.

Right now groff dumps core due to segmentation violation, but SunOS nroff
works fine.  Perhaps I will provide a formatted ASCII version in future
releases, if there is enough interest.
