This is the MGR server, the result of merging the old Linux server with
Stephen Uhler's last private version which was never released to the
net, plus debugging and rewriting some smaller parts.

The following MGRFLAGS can be used:

  FASTMOUSE           xor mouse cursor
  MOUSE_DEV="xxx"     usually /dev/mouse
  SCREEN_DEV="xxx"    name or device of screen buffer
  WHO                 make utmp entries for windows
  VI                  code for vi mouse hack
  DEBUG               turns on lots of buggy (!) debugging code (for -d option)
  BUCKEY              for keyboard operated "mouse" commands
  PRIORITY            for priority window scheduling instead of round-robin; the
                      active window gets higher priority
  KILL                kills windows upon tty i/o errors
  NOSTACK             don't permit event stacking
  BELL                ring the noisy bell on Suns
  KBD                 mess the kbd up on Suns
  MOVIE               MOVIE MGR (not complete yet)
  REGION_HACK         set window size when using text regions

I don't know if the new popen is needed or if it can be made obsolete by
changes in the server.  The debug stuff doesn't work correct.  The getshell
functions should be reviewed by someone who if more familar with ptys and
process groups etc.

There is some work done concerning 8 bit characters, they work for me.
Please report any problems.

The server now uses the selection-1.4 code for mice, so it should work
with most mice.  Thanks to Andrew Haylett (code) and Zeyd Ben Halim
(port).
