The bitblit library is divided into very machine dependent bit blit
code, almost machine independent code to read and write bitmaps with a
portable format from a file, and also almost machine independent
functions for logging bit blit operations.

These are all still useful bit blit libraries I know of.  All except the
linux and the portable Sun library are compressed.  You will probably
never need them.  There is also the new Sun colour bitblit library,
which isn't merged into the release yet.  You should look at it if you
are interested in bitblit semantics for colour.

The movie stuff needs quite some work.  It misses portable functions for
reading logged records and functions to write data with the same byte
sex as they are read, which is big endian.  I think converting it to
little endian breaks things with already existing logs -- so another
fight for the right :) order is lost.
