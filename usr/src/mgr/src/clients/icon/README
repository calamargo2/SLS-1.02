For some reason *I* don't know, most clients used \r to terminate their
event strings.  I changed the client-server protocol to be clean of any 
changes, so you can rely on the fact that each byte will get through 
without changes, e.g. bitmaps can be transported in both directions.  
Well, \r is a bad idea now, because fgets needs \n to terminate and \r 
are no longer translated to \n by the kernel.

So, if your favourite client doesn't work, you know what to check.
