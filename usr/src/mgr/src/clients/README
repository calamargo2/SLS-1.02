These are all MGR clients I could get.  Some of them may be system specific,
most of them are messy.  If you have a client which isn't contained here,
send it to me.  I will collect them all.  The directory structure could still
be improved, but it is better than when I got things ...

The MOVIE MGR stuff is quite unportable, not nice structured with respect
to MGR not running on a Sun workstation.  The manual look promising however,
so let's get it to work :)

mgrload isn't part of the default installation, because it requires a
compiled module of ps, so compilation will fail very likely on your
machine unless you provide that module.
