This is TeXMGR, a dvi file viewer.  I haven't tested it, but at least it
compiles on my machine.  If you have any improvements, bug fixes,
suggestions, then send me cdiffs.  I think TeXMGR is a good argument for
MGR on small systems, we could need more clients like it.

If someone tells me that TeXMGR works ok, I will move the definitions of the
local Configfile into the global one.
