My first implementation tried to be clean and used the MGR server and
the Hershey font functions from libmgr.  It was clean, but awful slow.
This implementation is a few hundred times faster.  It doesn't use the
server or even the MGR bitblit library at all, so it being portable is
not an issue.  It does however use some code from graph_subs.c in the
MGR server, written by Stephen A. Uhler.

The driver isn't finished yet, special characters, arcs and splines are
missing yet.  The created pbm files can be printed with pbmtoprt,
written by a friend.  If you don't have your own filter to print pbm
files then tell me and I will include thiis program into the
distribution.
