The Linux port was a reather quick hack, I cleaned a few things up and
made an interface to get the current load using /proc/loadavg.

The original code was quite system depedent.  I suggest that a port to a
new system consists of a `uname`.c module, which provides a function
getload(), returning the load as a double.  This function has to do all
required initialisations, if neccessary.  mgrload should not contain any
machine dependent code at all.

I provided the old code to show how load is get on the respecting systems.
