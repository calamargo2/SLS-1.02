rcond:

Syntax:	cond( A )

Description:	

	Rcond computes an estimate of the condition number of the
	input matrix. rcond() uses the LAPACK routines DGECON, or
	ZGECON.

	Probably the most published way to compute the condition of a
	matrix is:

	Kcond = ||A|| * ||inv(A)||

	Another method is to use the 1st and last singular values of
	A:

	Kcond = sigma(1)/sigma(n)

	cond() computes an ESTIMATE of the condition number without
	computing all of the columns of inv(A). For more information
	see the LAPACK User's Guide.
