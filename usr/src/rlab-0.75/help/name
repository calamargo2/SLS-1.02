name:

Syntax:	name ( A )

Description:

	Name returns the name of it's argument. Why would you want a
	function that returns the name of it's argument, when you must
	know the name in order to use the function ? The name function
	is only useful inside user-functions. If name() returns the
	string "dummy", the the argument is either named "dummy", or
	is a dummy argument in the function argument list.

	Also name will return the string "CONSTANT" if it's argument
	was a numeric constant

	Examples:

	> function t ( a , b , c ) {
	>   name(a)
	>   name(b)
	>   name(c)
	> }
	> t ( a , b , c )
	a
	b
	c

	> t ( )
	dummy
	dummy
	dummy

	> t ( x , y )
	x
	y
	dummy

	> t ( 0 , 0 , 0 )
