WHILE:

	The RLaB while statement is similar to the C while statement.

	Example:

	> i=1;
	> while(i<10)
	  {
	    a[i] = 1.3*i;
	    i++;
	  }
	> a
	 a =
	 matrix columns 1 thru 5
	         1.3         2.6         3.9         5.2         6.5
	
	 matrix columns 6 thru 9
	         7.8         9.1        10.4        11.7

	while(0) { "this will never be executed"? }

	If the conditional evaluates to zero then the loop is not
	executed, if it evaluates to anything other than zero it will
	be executed until the condition is zero.
