getline:

Syntax:	getline ( "filename" )

Description:

	Getline returns an N-element list which contains all of the
	tokens from a line in the file described by "filename". The
	tokens are delimited by whitespace. Numbers are installed in
	the list as numeric scalars, everything else is installed as
	scalar strings. 

	The list elements have numeric indices, and are numbered from
	1 to N. The 1st element containing the 1st token on the line,
	and the Nth element containing the last token on the line. The
	newline is not returned as a token.

	Getline will also recognize everything enclosed within a pair
	of `"' as a string, including escape characters.

	Getline will always return a list-object. When an empty-line
	has been read, getline returns an empty list. Getline will
	terminate on an End-Of-File (EOF).

	The filename can be a string that specifies a sub-process (see
	`help FILES'), in which case getline() will run the
	sub-process, and read from the process's standard output.

	Examples:

	To get input interactively:

	> printf( "Enter a string and a number: " ); x = getline( "stdin" );
	Enter a string and a number: test-string 1.234e5
	> show(x)
	   name:   x     
	   class:  list  
	       n:  2     
	> x.[1]
	test-string
	> x.[2]
	 2 =
	 1.23e+05

	Given a file named `test', which contains the following lines:

	jcool  259  4 1075  822 vt01     S   Dec 29  9:32 X :0 -p 1 -s 5 
	jcool  256  0   21    0 console  S   Dec 29  0:00 startx 
	jcool  261  0  338   88 console  S   Dec 29  0:16 twm 
	jcool  288  8  635  333 ?        S   Dec 29  2:00 emacs 
	jcool  287  0  408   65 console  S   Dec 29  0:01 xclock 
	
	tmp = getline( "test" );
	
	would produce a list variable named `tmp' with 16 elements:
	tmp.[1] would be the string "jcool" and tmp.[16] would be the
	number 5.  The next call to getline() would read the second
	line in the file, and create a new list containing those
	elements.

	The above could also have been done with:

	tmp = getline( "|ps -aux | grep jcool" )

	Which would open a readable pipe to the "ps -aux | grep jcool"
	command and grab a line at a time from the process.
	
	To read the entire contents of a file:

	if (length (ans = getline("stdin"))) 
	{ 
	  // do somethinf with ans
	else
	  // finish up
        }

	Since getline returns an empty list when there is no input, we
	can tell when to terminate the input loop by checking the
	length of the returned list.
