sprintf:

Syntax:	sprintf ( string_variable , format_string , VARi ... )

Description:
	
	The RLaB sprintf() is a limited feature version of the
	C-language sprintf(). The features are limited because RLaB
	does not support all of the data types the C-language does.

	string_variable: The output of sprintf is written to this
	variable. 

	format_string: A valid sprintf format string.

	VARi: Are any number of constants or variables that match the
	format string. sprintf() cannot print out vector, matrix, or
	list objects as a whole. Valid print objects are strings,
	constants, and scalars.
