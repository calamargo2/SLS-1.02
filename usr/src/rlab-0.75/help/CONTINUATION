CONTINUATION:

	The continuation characters used in RLaB are `...'. This is
	similar to the MATLAB v4.0 continuation.

	Example:

	> a = [1,2,3,...
	>      4,5,6,...
	>      7,8,9]
	 a =
	 matrix columns 1 thru 5
	           1           2           3           4           5
	
	 matrix columns 6 thru 9
	           6           7           8           9
