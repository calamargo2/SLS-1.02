RELATIONAL:

	RLaB relational operators are:

	<	less than
	>	greater than
	<=	less then, or equal to
	>=	greater than, or equal to

	The relational operators all have the same precedence.
		
	RLaB equality operators:

	==	equals
	!=	not equals

	The equality operators have the same precedence, and are just
	below the relational operators, in terms of precedence.

	RLaB logical operators are:

	&&	and
	||	or

	The logical operators do not have the same precedence. The
	logical AND operation has higher precedence than logical OR.
	Both logical operators are lower in precedence than the
	equality operators.

	The logical operators evaluate left-to-right (similar to C).
	But, evaluation does not stop as soon as the result is known.
	Full evaluation in required because the operands are not
	restricted to being simple scalars quantities. Cases where the
	operands are matrices requires that full operand evaluation
	occur.
	
	And finally:

	!	unary negation

	Which has higher precedence than all the arithmetic operators.
