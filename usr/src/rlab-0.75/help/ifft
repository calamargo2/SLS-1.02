ifft:

Syntax:	ifft ( X )

Description:

	Ifft utilizes the FFTPACK subroutine CFFTB to compute a
	discrete Fourier transform of the input. The output is NOT
	scaled, so that a call to fft() followed by a call to ifft()
	will reproduce the original input.

	Subroutine CFFTB computes the backward complex discrete
	Fourier transform (the Fourier synthesis). equivalently, CFFTB
	computes a complex periodic sequence from its Fourier
	coefficients.

	for j=1,...,n

           c(j)=the sum from k=1,...,n of

               	 c(k)*exp(i*(j-1)*(k-1)*2*pi/n)

                     	 where i=sqrt(-1)

	The argument `x' must be a matrix. If x is a row, or column
	matrix then a vector ifft is performed. If x is a MxN matrix
	then the N columns of x are ifft'ed.
