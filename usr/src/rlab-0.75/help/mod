mod:

Syntax: mod( A , B )

Description:

	The mod routine returns the floating point remainder of the
	division of A by B: zero if B is zero or if A/B would
	overflow; otherwise the number F with the same sign as A, such
	that A = iB + F for some integer i, and |f| < |B|.

	When the arguments to mod are two matrices, then an element by
	element mod is performed. Mod works on complex number also.

	mod(x,y) is equivalent to: n = int( x/y )
				   mod(x,y) = x - y.*n				   

	mod() is implemented via libm.a fmod() function.
