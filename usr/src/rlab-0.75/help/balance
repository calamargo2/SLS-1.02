balance:

Syntax:	balance ( a )

Description:

	Balance uses the LAPACK subroutines DGEBAL and ZGEBAL to
	balance the input matrix so that the row and column norms are
	approximately equal.

	balance() returns a list with elements `t' and `ab'.

	ab = inv(t)*a*t

	And ab is the balanced matrix.

	Only square matrices are allowed.
