class:

Syntax:	class ( A )

	Class returns a string which identifies the type of the object
	that A represents.

	class([1,2;3,4]) will return `matrix'. The recognized types
	are:

	scalar
	matrix
	string
	list
	bltin
	user-function

	It is often useful to:

	if(class(m) == "matrix") {

	  // Perform matrix related operation.

	}


	The class of a variable can also be determined by using the
	class member reference (except for LISTs), like:

	> zeros.class
	bltin
