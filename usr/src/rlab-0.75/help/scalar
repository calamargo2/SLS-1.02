scalar:

Syntax:	scalar ( A )

Description:

	The scalar function attempts to cast (convert) it's argument
	to a scalar.

	scalar( 2 )

	will produce a scalar with value 2.

	scalar()

	will produce a scalar with value of zero.

	scalar(v[1])

	will convert the 1st element of v to a scalar.

	scalar(m[2;3])

	will convert an element of a MATRIX to a scalar.

	Scalar is provided mostly for symmetry with the matrix()
	functions. Functionally it is not really necessary since scalar
	references to matrices are automatically demoted to SCALAR
	type.
