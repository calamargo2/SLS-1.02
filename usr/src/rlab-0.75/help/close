close:

Syntax:	close ( "filename" )

Description:

	close() takes a string as input, and attempts to close the
	output stream associated with the string. close() returns TRUE
	(1) if the output stream was successfully closed, FALSE (0) if
	the output stream could not be closed.

	If you want to read the contents of a file that you have
	created with the write() function in the present session, then
	be sure to close the file before using the read function.

	Example:

	write( "eig_output", a , vec , val );
	close( "eig_output" );
	read( "eig_output" );
