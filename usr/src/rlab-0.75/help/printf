printf:

Syntax:	printf ( format_string , VARi ... )

Description:
	
	The RLaB printf() is a limited feature version of the
	C-language printf(). The features are limited because RLaB
	does not support all of the data type the C-language does.

	format_string: must be a valid printf format string

	VARi: are any number of constants or variables that match the
	format string. printf() cannot print out vector, matrix, or
	list objects as a whole. Valid print objects are strings,
	constants, and scalars.

	The following shows how one might print out the annotated
	contents of a matrix.

	for(i in 0:size(a)[0]-1) {
	  for(j in 0:size(a)[1]-1) {
	   printf("a[%i;%i] = %f\n", i, j, a[i;j]);
	  }
	}

	It would be more efficient to use:

	write("stdout", a);

	since write() knows how to deal with entire data objects.
