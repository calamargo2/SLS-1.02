sort:

Syntax:	sort ( A )

Description:

	If A is a vector (either row or column): 

	  Then sort returns a list, containing the sorted values and
	  indices. List element names are `val' and `ind'.

	If A is a matrix (m >= 2):

	  Then sort returns a list, containing a matrix with the
	  sorted columns of A, and a matrix containing the sorted
	  indices of A.

	Numerical matrices are sorted in ascending numerical value.
	Complex matrices are sorted by absolute value.
	String matrices are sorted alphabetically (using strcmp()).

	The sort function uses a simplistic version of qsort().
