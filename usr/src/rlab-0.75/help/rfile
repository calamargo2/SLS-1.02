rfile:

Syntax:	rfile
	rfile name

Description:

	rfile : Prints a list of all the files with a `.r' suffix. The
	        list is compiled by searching the directories
	        contained in the environment variable
	        `RLAB_SEARCH_PATH'. 

	rfile name : Loads the contents of the file denoted by `name'
	        into the workspace. The name argument is NOT a string,
	        and does not include the `.r' suffix. 

		Allowable names for rfiles are filenames that start
	        with:
			A digit, or a letter (a-z or A-Z).
		and contain:
			digits, letters, and/or `-' `_'

	        You may not be able to use all the possible filenames
	        allowed by the host operating system.

	If the user's environment does not contain RLAB_SEARCH_PATH,
	then the default search-path is used. The default is set at
	compile time. Normally the default is ".", the current working
	directory. 

	Rfile is a command, not an expression or statement. Therefore,
	it must be issued on a line by itself, and cannot occur in the
	midst of another statment or expression. See `help COMMAND'

	The command `rfile name' can be used more than once. Each time
	the command is issued the file `name.r' is loaded.

	The contents of the named file can be any valid RLaB commands
	or functions. There is no limit to the number of functions
	that a file can contain. Additionally, a mixture of commands,
	and function definitions can be included in the same file.
