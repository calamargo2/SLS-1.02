COMMAND:

	The RLaB language has a two commands at present. They are:
	`help' and `rfile'. Commands are different than functions, in
	that they do not require  parentheses to delimit the function
	argument(s). 

	Commands may not occur anywhere in an expression or statement.
	Therefore, commands must be issued from the command line
	prompt, on a line by themselves.
