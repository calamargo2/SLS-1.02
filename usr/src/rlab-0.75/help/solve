solve:

Syntax:	solve ( A , B )

Description:

	Solve solves a system of linear equations:

		A * X = B,	A is the coefficient matrix
				B is the right hand side
				X is the solution

	where A is the 1st, and B is the 2nd argument to solve(). The
	columns of B are the individual right hand sides.

	Solve returns a matrix of the solutions, where each column
	of the solution corresponds to a column of B.

	Solve uses the LAPACK subroutines DGETRF, and ZGETRF.
