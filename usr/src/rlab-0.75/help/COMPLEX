COMPLEX:

	RLaB supports COMPLEX data types. The "type" of a variable is
	revealed by typing:

		var.type

		or

		show(var)

	In the 1st instance the return value is a string, in the 2nd
	instance, the return value is a string matrix.

	Complex variables can be used via the MATLAB syntax:

	i = sqrt(-1)

	z = 1 + 2*i

	z = a + b*i

	or with RLaB's complex constant feature:

	z = 1 + 2i

	z = 1 + 2j	// equivalent to the previous statement

	The complex constants `i' and `j' do not interfere with
	ordinary variables `i' and `j' since the complex constants
	must immediately follow a number to be interpreted as a
	complex constant. 

	For example:

	1i	// valid complex constant

	1 i	// will generate a parse error


	Wherever it makes sense, built-in functions will accept real,
	and complex arguments. For example, inv(), det(), eig(), fft()
	will accept both real and complex inputs.
