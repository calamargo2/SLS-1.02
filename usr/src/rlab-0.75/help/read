read:

Syntax:	read( "filename" )

Description:

	read() reads the file identified by the "filename". The file
	is opened with read access, and all of the contents are read.
	The entities in the file are installed in the global symbol
	table, overwriting any existing entities. Upon completion the
	file is closed.

	Example:

	read("bunch_of_data_in_a_file");

See Also: FILES, close, write

Future Enhancements:

	read() should have the option to list the contents of a file
	without actually reading them into the symbol table. read()
	should also be able to install the read items on a list other
	than the global symbol table ( read("file"; sub_list_name);).
