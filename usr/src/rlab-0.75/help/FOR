FOR:

	The RLaB for statement is NOT similar to the C for statement.
	The correct usage is best shown by example...

	Example:

	> for(i in 1:4) {
	>   for(j in 1:5) {
	>     m[i;j] = i+j;
	>   }
	> }

	The above shows a nested set of for statements. i and j are
	automatically initialized to have the values of the vector
	expressions `1:4' and `1:5'. Each loop proceeds until i and j
	have been assigned each element of their respective vector
	expressions.

	The vector in the for statement can be any expression that
	evaluates to a SCALAR or a MATRIX. If the expression evaluates
	to a SCALAR the body of the for statement is executed ONCE.

	The for statement can be also be used to loop through the
	elements of a LIST.

	Example:

	> xlist = << Mass = sqrt(200); Inertia = eye(3,3); xdot = [1,2,3] >>
	   Inertia      Mass         xdot         
	> for( i in members(xlist) )
	  {
	    xlist.[i]
	  }
	 Inertia =
	 matrix columns 1 thru 3
	           1           0           0
	           0           1           0
	           0           0           1
	 Mass =
	       14.14
	 xdot =
	 matrix columns 1 thru 3
           1           2           3
