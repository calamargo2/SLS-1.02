Syntax:	writem ( "filename" , A )

Description:

	Writem is the counterpart to readm(). Writem writes the matrix
	A to the file denoted by the 1st argument in a generic format.
	
	The format used is:

	line 1:		nrow	ncol
	line 2:		value[1;1]    ... value[1;ncol] \n
	line nrow+1:	value[nrow;1] ... value[nrow;ncol] \n

	Writem will write real and complex numeric matrices, as well
	as string matrices even though readm can only read real numeric
	matrices.
