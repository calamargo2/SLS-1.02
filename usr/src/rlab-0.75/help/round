round:

Syntax:	round ( A )

Description:

	Round returns the nearest integer value to its floating point
	argument X as a double-precision floating point number. The
	returned value is rounded according to the currently set
	machine rounding mode. If round-to-nearest (the default mode)
	is set and the difference between the function argument and
	the rounded result is exactly 0.5, then the result will be
	rounded to the nearest even integer. 

	Round uses the libm.a function rint. If your machine does not
	have rint, then the supplied rint is used.
