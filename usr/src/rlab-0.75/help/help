help:

Syntax:	help
	help name

Description:

	help : Prints a list of available help files. Help first
	       prints out the help files in the default help file
	       directory. Next, the directories identified in the
	       environment variable RLAB_SEARCH_PATH are searched for
	       files ending in `.r' -- rfiles. A list of each
	       directory's rfiles is printed on the standard output.
	       
	help name : Prints out the help file identified by name. If
	       name matches a file in the default help directory, that
	       file is paged to the standard output. If no match is
	       found, the directories identified in the environment
	       variable RLAB_SEARCH_PATH are searched for matches. The
	       first match is paged to the standard output. The rfile
	       extension (`.r') is not considered when checking for
	       matches.

	If the user's environment does not contain RLAB_SEARCH_PATH,
	then the default search-path is used. The default is set at
	compile time. Normally the default is ".", the current working
	directory.

	Help is a command, not an expression or statement. Therefore,
	it must be issued on a line by itself, and cannot occur in the
	midst of another statment or expression. See `help COMMAND'.

	Help files that are spelled with uppercase letters contain
	general information, or information on keywords. For instance,
	`help MATRIX' provides general information about matrix usage,
	`help IF' provides help on if statements.
