SCALAR:

	In RLaB scalar numerics are objects distinct from matrices.
	Scalars are the most simple to use...

	> a = 1
		1
	> b = 1+2*sqrt(2+a)
		4.4641016

	Scalars can have real, or complex numeric values (a real part,
	and an imaginary part). A complex scalar is created by using a
	complex constant. A complex constant is entered with either an
	`i' or a `j' denoting the imaginary number...

	12.5i

	2j

	No spaces are allowed between the number and the `i' or `j'.
	So a complex variable can be created like:

	a = 1.5 - 3j

	You can also use the MATLAB approach...

	i = sqrt(-1);
	a = 1.5 - 3*i

	See `help COMPLEX' for more info on complex variables.

	Scalars can also have string values:

	str = "scalar string"

	See `help STRING' for more information.
