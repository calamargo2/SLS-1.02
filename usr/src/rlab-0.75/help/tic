tic:

Syntax:	tic ( )

Description:

	Tic internally marks the time at which it was invoked. To
	measure elapsed time, use tic() in conjunction with toc().

	Example:

	tic();
	a = rand(100,100);
	eig(a);
	toc()

	The above would measure the time spent generating the 100x100
	random matrix, and calculating the eigenvectors and values.
