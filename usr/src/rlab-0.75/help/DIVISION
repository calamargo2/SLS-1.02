DIVISION:

	There are two type of division operators, the `/' and the '\'.
	The 1st is called "right-division", and the 2nd is called
	"left-division". 

	Right-Division: For scalars the result is what you would
	expect. For matrices, A / B is the same as A * inv(B). But,
	what really happens is A / B is implemented like (B' \ A')'

	The element-by-element version of right-division, `./' is
	simply A[i;j] / B[i;j].

	Left-Division: For scalars the result of A \ B is B / A. For
	matrices the result is the solution to A*X = B. If B has more
	than one column, then the result is an X that contains a
	column for every column of B, which are the solutions to
	A*x[;i] = B[;i].

	If A is non-square, then a least-squares solution is
	performed using the LAPACK subroutines DGESSL, or ZGESSL.
	(actually these are always used).

	The element-by-element version, `.\' is simply B[i;j] /
	A[i;j].
