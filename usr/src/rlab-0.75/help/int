int:

Syntax:	int ( a )

Description:

	Int returns it's argument after it has been "cast" to an
	integer. If the argument is a MATRIX then the int operation is
	performed on an element-by-element basis.

	int() has the effect of truncating the input, for example:

	> int(1.1)
	           1
	> int(1.5)
	           1
	> int(1.999)
	           1
