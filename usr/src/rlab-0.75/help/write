write:

Syntax:	write ( "filename" , a , b , ... )

Description:
	
	The write function takes at least two arguments. The 1st
	argument is the string that identifies the file to write to.
	The file is opened with write permission, destroying any
	pre-existing contents. The file is left open so that
	subsequent writes will not destroy the contents.

	The arguments after the file name are the entities that will
	be written.

	Example:

	write( "file_name", a , b , c );

	Will open the file named `file_name' in write mode, and write
	the contents of the variables a, b, and c.

	write( "stdout" , list );

	Will write the contents of the list-object named `list' to the
	standard output.

Future Enhancements (?):

	The write function should be able to write out the entire
	contents of the global symbol table.
