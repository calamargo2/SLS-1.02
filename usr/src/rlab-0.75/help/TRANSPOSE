TRANSPOSE:

	The RLaB transpose operator is `''. To create the transpose of
	a MATRIX type:

	> m
	 m =
	 matrix columns 1 thru 3
	           1           2           3
	           4           5           6
	           7           8           9
	> m'
	 matrix columns 1 thru 3
	           1           4           7
	           2           5           8
	           3           6           9


	The transpose produces the complex conjugate transpose of a
	complex object.

	If you need the non-conjugate transpose of a matrix, the try:

	> conj( m' );

	Or use the element (or array) oriented transpose operator .'
	For real matrices, and strings the effect of .' is the same as
	'. However, for complex matrices, the effect is to produce a
	non-conjugate transpose.
