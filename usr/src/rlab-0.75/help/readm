readm:

Syntax:	readm ( "filename" )

Description:

	Readm reads a generic matrix of data from the file denoted by
	the argument. The return value is the newly created matrix.

	The first line of the file must contain two numbers which
	describe the number of rows, and the number of columns of
	data. The rest of the file contains the matrix data. Columns
	are separated by whitespace, and rows are separated by
	newlines. Readm can only read in numeric matrices. The result
	of reading in string matrices is undefined.

	Example:

	3 4
	1 2 3 4
	5 6 7 8
	9 10 11 12

	The abive values in a file called "test" would be read in like:

	> a = readm("test")
	 a =
	 matrix columns 1 thru 4
	        1          2          3          4  
	        5          6          7          8  
	        9         10         11         12  

	Readm can only read in real numeric matrices.

	Readm exists to read in data from other programs. In many
	cases a simple awk script will filter the other programs
	output into one or more columns of data. readm() will read the
	data into the matrix, then the matrix can be reshaped.
