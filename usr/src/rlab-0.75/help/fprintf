fprintf:

Syntax:	fprintf ( file_string , format_string , VARi ... )

Description:
	
	The RLaB fprintf() is a limited feature version of the
	C-language fprintf(). The features are limited because RLaB
	does not support all of the data types the C-language does.

	file_string: The 1st string argument determines the file to
	which the output is sent. If the filename starts with a '|'
	then a pipe is opened to the process following the '|' and the
	output is written to the pipe. For example:

	> fprintf("|gnuplot"; "set term X11\n plot sin(x)\n");

	will create the sub-process gnuplot, and pipe the command
	string to it.

	format_string: A valid fprintf format string.

	VARi: Are any number of constants or variables that match the
	format string. fprintf() cannot print out vector, matrix, or
	list objects as a whole. Valid print objects are strings,
	constants, and scalars.
