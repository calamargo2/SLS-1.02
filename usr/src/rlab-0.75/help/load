load:

Syntax:	load( "filename" )

Description:

	Load opens the file name denoted by string argument and reads
	it's contents as though a user were typing the contents at the
	command line. Thus a user can use load() to enter data,
	user-functions, or execute repetitive commands saved in a
	file.

	Immediately after the the input is read, load() closes the
	file, so that subsequent calls to load() will re-open the
	file. 

	Load cannot be used from within user-functions, or loops.
	Load simply points RLaB's input stream at the specified file,
	and restores the input stream when the file has been read.

	Load requires that a complete file specification be provided.
	If the file is in the present working directory, then only the
	filename is necessary otherwise, a complete path is required.

	In most cases the rfile command is simpler to use.

	Example:

	// load the roots() function into memory
	> load( "roots.r" )
