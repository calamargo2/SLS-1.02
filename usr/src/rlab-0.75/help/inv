inv:

Syntax:	inv ( A )

Description:

	Inv computes the matrix-inverse of a square matrix. If the
	matrix is near singular, inv() will print a warning message,
	and stop. The near singular condition is determined by
	comparing the estimated matrix condition number (from rcond())
	with the machines double precision epsilon.

	Inv uses the LAPACK subroutines DGETRF, DGETRI, or ZGETRF,
	and ZGETRI.
