system:

Syntax:	system ( "command" )

Description:

	The system function behaves like the the UNIX system call. The
	string argument to system is passed directly to the
	bourne-shell for execution. The program waits until the
	system call is finished.

	Example:

	> system( "vi test.r" )

	will allow the user to edit (create) the file test.r. When the
	vi process is finished the user will be back at the RLaB
	prompt.

	> rfile test

	will then load the result of the vi process.
