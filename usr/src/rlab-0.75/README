	Rlab is _not_ a clone of languages such as those used by tools
	like MATLAB or matrix_X/Xmath. However, as Rlab focuses on
	creating a good experimental environment (or laboratory) in
	which to do matrix math, it can be called "MATLAB-like" since
	the programming language possesses similar operators and
	concepts.  Extensive use has been made of the LAPACK, FFTPACK
	and RANLIB sources available from netlib.

	The most significant difference between the other proprietary
	tools and RLaB is the GNU Copyleft.

	See the file README.install for installation instructions.
