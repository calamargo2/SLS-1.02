DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       eeffsscckk is used to check a Linux extended file system.
       _d_e_v_i_c_e  is  the  special  file corresponding to the device
       (e.g /dev/hdXX).

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       _-_l     List all the file names in the file system

       _-_a     Automatically repair the file  system  without  any
              questions (use this option with caution).

       _-_r     Interactively  repair the file system (ask for con-
              firmations).

       _-_v     Verbose mode.

       _-_s     List the super block before checking the file  sys-
              tem.

       _-_d     Print  debugging output (useless unless you want to
              find a bug in eeffsscckk ).

       _-_t     Check the file system for bad blocks.

       _-_S     Salvage (i.e. rebuild) the blocks and  inodes  free
              lists.

       _-_b _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
              Read the bad blocks list from _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e

AAUUTTHHOORR
       eeffsscckk is based on ffsscckk ((88)) written by Linus Torvalds <tor-
       valds@cs.helsinki.fi> for the minix file system.
       Remy  Card  <card@masi.ibp.fr>  has  adapted  it  for  the
       extended file system and is maintaining it.
       Wayne  Davison  <davison@borland.com> has contributed lots
       of nice features.

BBUUGGSS
       There is no support for a directory lost+found.
       When a mounted file system is checked, super block  infor-
       mations  are  modified  on  the disk and not in the memory
       copy.
       Please report bugs to the author.
