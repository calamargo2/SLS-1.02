.TH TRUE 1L \" -*- nroff -*-
.SH NAME
true \- do nothing, successfully
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B true
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page
documents the GNU version of
.B true
(and probably every other version, as well).
.B true
does nothing except return an exit status of 0, meaning ``success''.
It can be used as a place holder in shell scripts where a successful
command is needed, although the shell built-in command `:' (colon)
does the same thing faster.
