This is a version of tetris which compiles and runs with ncurses under
Linux. I've made significant modifications to the original sources that
this could be considered deravative work.

Change UHEIGHT to fit your screen. Modify the values in timings if the
game seems too fast or too slow.

========================================================================

This version on tetris should run on any system V and xenix system
which supports the curses library.
Carefully look at the begging of the Makefile, then make and run.

I used the game-logic of the version posted to the net by Phill Everson
<everson@cs.bris.ac.uk> and Martyn Shortley <shortley@cs.bris.ac.uk>_

Let bob@usixth know about any bug, fixes, enhancements and so on.
If you have curses which support colors, it should be easy
to modify set1pixel in main.c to attrset, depending on the value of col.
