This directory contains the Linux port of ingres8.9 DBMS.

ingres04.lzh is the most recent and complete distribution.
It includes a couple of fixes for 386BSD. I still don't know what flag it
uses to identify itself uniquely (a la -Dlinux for Linux)

###
If you d/led the earlier distribution (called ingres.lzh) then
the files update[1-3]/lzh fix some mistakes in the distribution.
###

You need lha (pub/linux/sources/Archivers/lha-1.00.tar.Z)
and byacc (in the same directory as ingres).

You'll need ~2.5MB to extract the system. You'll need the same again to build
the system.

This is a SOURCE only distribution. You need to build the whole system from
scratch.
1) READ the document setup.ingres.
1+) If you are compiling this on anything other than Linux
	cd to .../source
	change Config accordingly
2) cd to .../source/conf
3) type make allinstall 2>&1 |tee log
4) go and see a movie or something...
5) assuming all is well go to the home directory and run INSTALL.ME.

To give ingres a try read .../doc/other/tutorial.doc
For those interested in the internals see .../doc/other/design.doc
For those wanting to create and maintain their own databases see
.../other/maintain.doc

I suggest you print out all docs and keep handy if you want to use INGRES.
