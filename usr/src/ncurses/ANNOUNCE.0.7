I have uploaded version 0.7 of ncurses to :-
netcom.com:pub/zmbenhal/ncurses0.7.tar.Z
It should also appear some day on:
tsx-11.mit.edu:pub/linux/sources/libs.
sunsite.unc.edu:pub/Linux/Incoming.

Please note that the next release will be called 1.8. If you want to know about
the rationale drop me a line.

ncurses is a SYSV-compatible curses (screen management) package.
It supports keypad() allowing access to function and arrow keys.
It supports and uses Terminfo instead of termcap for terminal description.
It has support for PC graphic characters (used in drawing boxes).
It has color support similar to that in SYSV curses.
It supports SYSVR4 curses with many more functions and identical behavior.

Included are several test programs in test/.
I've split up the panels library, reversi, tetris, sokoban. They are now
available separately from netcom.com:pub/zmbenhal/

Changes from 0.6 to 0.7:
color and ACS support is now fully compatible with SYSV at the terminfo level.
Capabilities now includes as many SYSV caps I could find.
tigetflag,tigetnum,tigetstr functions added.
boolnames, boolfnames, boolcodes
numnames, numfnames, numcodes,
strnames, strfnames, strcodes arrays are now added.
keyname() is added.
All function keys can be defined in terminfo entries.
fixed lin_tparm.c to behave properly.
terminfo entries for vt* and xterm are included (improvements are welcome)
more automation in handling caps and keys.
included fixes from 0.6.1
added a few more missing functions.
fixed a couple of minor bugs.
updated docs JUST a little (still miles behind in documenting the newer
	features).

v0.1 July 31, 1992
v0.2 August 14, 1992
v0.3 January 20, 1993
v0.4 February 3, 1993
v0.5 February 14, 1993

NB. PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE SENDING PATCHES:
This is not intended as a flame (I'm very grateful for the people who did) BUT
1) most functions should be defined as returning int even though most of them
	don't return anything. Don't blame me, that's how sysv does it.
2) leave cosmetic changes to me. they simply make the patches larger and less
	comprensible. Don't assume all the changes you've made will be done.
3) don't fix things unless you know it's broke and YOU can fix it. Don't
	incorporate code from other sources.
4) I would be grateful for code the illustrates the behavior before and after
	any fixes, but I'll take your word(s).

Any comments, bug reports, patches, additions are welcome.
If you have a program that's having problems running with ncurses either send
me a copy of it or tell where I can get a copy.
