I've made patches for ncurses 0.6 to correct a few problems:

1) Included the missing data/console.

2) allow attributes when drawing boxes.

3) corrected usage of win->_delay value.

4) fixed a bug in lib_getch.c. if it didn't recognize a sequence it would
	simply return the last character in the sequence. The correct
	behavior is to return the entire sequence one character at a time.

The patches are available from netcom.com:pub/zmbenhal/patch0.6-0.61
They should appear on tsx-11 and sunsite soon.
