NAME
       tic - Compile the terminfo database

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/lib/terminfo/tic [-v[n]] source-file

DESCRIPTION
       Tic  is	the  program which translates the source files in
       the  terminfo  terminal	capability  database  into  their
       object  format.	The given file is expected to contain one
       or more terminfo entries,  as  described	in  terminfo(5).
       This  file  is expected to be self-contained, i.e., it may
       not contain ``use'' entries which refer to  terminals  not
       described fully in the same file.

       The  object files are normally placed in subdirectories of
       the directory /usr/lib/terminfo (see term(5)), but if  the
       environment  variable  TERMINFO is defined, it is taken to
       be the name of an alternate directory to use.

       Debugging and tracing information may be obtained  by  use
       of  the	-v  flag.  The number after the flag controls the
       amount of debugging information given,  according  to  the
       following table:

       1      Names of files created and linked

       2      Information related to the ``use'' facility

       3      Statistics from the hashing algorithm

       5      String-table memory allocations

       7      Entries into the string-table

       8      List of tokens encountered by scanner

       9      All  values  computed  in	construction of the hash
	      table

	 If n is not given, it is taken to be one.

FILES
       /usr/lib/terminfo/* Default location of object files
