NAME
       untic  - Print the contents of a compiled terminfo file in
       human-readable form

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/lib/terminfo/untic file ...

DESCRIPTION
       Dump reads the given files and decodes their  contents  to
       derive  a  reasonable representation of the terminfo entry
       which produced the file originally.  It should  be  noted,
       in case of emergency, that the output of dump is perfectly
       usable as the input to compile(1).

SEE ALSO
       untic(1), term(5), terminfo(5)
