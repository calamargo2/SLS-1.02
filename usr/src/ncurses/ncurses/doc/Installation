             How to install Ncurses/Terminfo on your system 
			  Version 0.7
                    (next version will called 1.8)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Assumptions: You have unpacked the distribution into an empty directory.
You found this file in a subdirectory of that one called '=doc'.
There are several other subdirectories, called '=src', '=test', '=data'

1.  Decide where you want to put the object files and source files
    of terminal descriptions.  On my system (and I recommend it for
    you), the directory /usr/lib/terminfo is used.  If you really can't 
    stand the idea (remember, this is not where the C language source 
    code to the library will go; this is where the actual terminal
    descriptions and their object files will go), you'll need to do
    these steps (skip these if you're being reasonable or lazy):
	a. Keep in mind that this directory should probably be
	   in your root filesystem so that programs which use terminfo
	   can be used even when the system is only up single-user.
	b. Change the value of the variable SRCDIR in =src/Makefile
	   to the name of the directory you've chosen.
	c. Change the man pages in =doc to reflect the name-change.

2.  Change to the subdirectory =src and type 'make'.  Ignore any warnings,
    no error-messages should be produced.  This should compile the library
    with tracing, the terminfo compiler (tic) and the untic program.  Then
    type 'make install' to copy the header files into /usr/include,   copy
    the compiler  and dump programs  into the directory  chosen in step 1,
    and copy the versions of the library into /usr/lib.  You will probably
    need to be super-user to do this.

3.  Doing 'make install' will also compile your console terminfo entry. No 
	error messages of any sort should be produced.

4.  Change to the subdirectory =test and type 'make'.  This should compile
    all of the test programs  in the release.  Once again, there should be
    no errors.

5.  The games perviously packaged with ncurses are now available separately
	from netcom.com:pub/zmbenhal

6.  The panels library is also available separately from the same place.


NOTES:

	The library is stored in /usr/lib/libncurses.a, unless you changed
	the Makefile.  Note the 'n'!!  Programs wishing to use the new
	package should say "-lncurses" on their 'cc' command while those
	wanting the old package should still say '-lcurses'.

	Similarly, the curses header file should be included using
			#include <ncurses.h>

	The header file <term.h> has been included so that programs
        which work only at the terminfo-level need not worry about name
	conflicts with the rest of the package. By including <term.h> 
	instead of <ncurses.h>,  they will get everything needed for the 
	terminfo-level routines.

	[N.B. term.h is one of several file built automatically by make. see
	=src/Makefile]
