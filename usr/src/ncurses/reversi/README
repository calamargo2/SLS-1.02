		    COMPILING AND INSTALLING

Edit the Makefile to suit Your needs and enter "make" or "make
install". The program should compile without problems on any
ANSI-C compiler. If You don't have an ANSI-C compiler at hand You
might have to change the struct initializations for the menu
routines by hand.

The game has been tested on several machines (VAX 11/750 running
BDS4.3, DECstation 3100 running Ultrix 4.2, i486 running Linux,
i486 running Interactive Unix. The game was compiled with GCC on
all systems).

If You have problems compiling the game, please send me a mail
describing You problems and eventually what You did to fix it. I
would like to see that this game compiles and runs sucessfully on
as many machines as possible.


			PLAYING THE GAME

When the game starts up You will be presented with a menu. Move
the pointer using "j" and "k", select with RETURN. In the game
You move the cursor using "h", "j", "k" and "l", and You place a
tile on the board using SPACE. A menu with variuos selections is
available by pressing ESC.

In-game documentation is available by pressing "?" at any time in
the game.


Please send bug reports and suggestions to: elias@proxxi.se. Send
