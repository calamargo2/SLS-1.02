These are binary utilities used by Linux, which are based on the GNU
binutils.tar.Z.

There is a long story why it looks like the way it is now, which I
don't want to go into details.

Please use makefile.linux as base for your Makefile. I didn't get time
to test them, You are more than welcome to fix any bugs it may have. If
you have any problems, please drop me note.
