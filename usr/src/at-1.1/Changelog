Fixed a bug combination in at/atrun which meant that files could
be deleted before being executed, now fiddling with the x - bit
(for execution) and the r - bit (for deletion).

Added -d, -l and -q options with handling.

Fixed a bug in atrun, where the wrong letters from the filename
was used for determining niceness.

Added making a distribution, hopefully without clobbering too much...
