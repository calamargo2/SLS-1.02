Matt Dillon's UUCP for the Amiga version 1.15D, does not have a working
popen(). The following code was posted by someone (I lost the name
unfortunately). I have fixed a bug in the code.

If you do not have a working popen(), or mktemp() then install these files
in the uucp library source directory and regenerate the library. Actually,
you do not need to put these functions into the uucp library. The important
thing is that the metamail code can link with popen.o and mktemp.o.

metamail uses both popen() and mktemp().
