AcctKit 0.2

This kit of pieces adds process accounting to the standard Linux kernel. It
contains a diff file relative to the 0.99.8 + Linus Patch1, a new include
file and ports of the BSD NET2 accton and lastcomm commands.

***Important: The lastcomm and accton programs from this kit are part of the
BSD NET2 release. See lastcomm.c and accton.c for the UCB licensing
conditions


To install:

unpack the tar file into some directory. I've called it PACKDIR for the
instructions

cd /usr/src
patch < PACKDIR/acct.diff
cp PACKDIR/acct.h /usr/include/linux/acct.h
cd PACKDIR
mv accton /etc/accton
mv lastcomm /usr/bin/lastcomm
touch /usr/adm/acct


Build a new kernel.

With this new kernel you can enable accounting with
'accton /usr/adm/acct' disable it with 'accton', and
look at command histories with lastcomm {user}.

Limitations
-----------

I don't implement memory, pagefault or disk usage logging,
just commands and whether it ran as root. Its enough for
my purposes with our computer society system.
