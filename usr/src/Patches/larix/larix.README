Larix - Load and run in kernel space.

Suggested for all working on device drivers or filesystems.

This is also helpful for people who are working on modifying one 
specific system call.

This can be considered as an alpha testing release, although I'm more
or less finished with it. (i.e. I'd put it in a alpha testing directory)

The file contains manuals.

Bugs, questions etc. can be sent to me:
