Type `make` to create libipc.a and programs in this directory.  
Set BINDIR and LIBDIR in the Makefile and `make install` if you like. 
You may want to edit ipcs.c to set resource limits (see ipc.info). 
Copy ipc.info to your info directory and edit the file "dir" in that 
directory to add a node for ipc.

Files in this directory:

1) libipc.a
	wrappers for ipc system calls. All programs that use
	ipc must be linked with -lipc.

2) ipcs, ipcrm
	programs to initialize ipc facilities. 
	edit ipcs and set values that you want to change.

You must run ipcs to initialize ipc before running other 
programs.

3) Testing programs
	msgtst : server/client msg passing program .... Bach.
  	msgloop : shell script to run msgtst vigorously.
	philos : dining philosophers as an action system. Output to ./philolog.
        (check with the author about distribution ... see philos.c). 

  Interactive programs to exercise system calls from Sun examples.
	msgget, msgctl.
	semget, semctl, semop.
	shmget, shmop, shmctl.
