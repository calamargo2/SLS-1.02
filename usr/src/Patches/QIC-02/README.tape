This describes a driver for QIC-02 tape drive support for Linux 0.96a.

NOTE1: This will not work for the QIC-40/QIC-80 tape drives, like the
well-known tape drives that attach to the floppy controller.
NOTE2: If you are working on another (e.g. SCSI or QIC-40) tape driver,
please try to use the same sys/mtio.h file! Also, join the TAPE mailing
list!

This code has not been tested in combination with SCSI driver(s).
If you do, make sure you use different interrupts, dma numbers 
and IO addresses! You'll also have to copy the contents of config.dist.h
into config.site.h.

+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| WARNING: This code is still beta -- There *are* bugs in it! |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+

NOTE: Make sure you get all the required files from this directory,
just the patches aren't enough! There may be a tar file with additional
source files. You'll also need the `mt' program. [Should be somewhere
in this directory too.]

Instructions:

	0) Read all of the README and the current `release' files.

	1) Backup your entire system onto floppies. [Seriously ...]

	2) Get a clean kernel source tree. [No other patches.]

	3) Unpack the file tpqic02*.tar in your Linux source dir.
	   [Actual filenames may vary with different versions.]

	4) Apply the required patches:
		patch -p0 <tpqic02.pat
	   Update the config.site.h to reflect your hardware setup.
	   Be careful to avoid DMA/IO/IRQ conflicts!
	   Do a `make dep', followed by a `make clean'.

	5) Make a new kernel, on floppy, that boots from floppy.
	   This is for testing, and recovery after a hd-crash.

	6) Compile GNU 'mt' (with minor patches by me). [Or use the pre-
	   compiled binary.] Put them on the root floppy. Don't forget
	   to link them statically if you're not using shared libs on
	   the root floppy!

	7) Make a new root floppy disk.
	   'mk-tp-root.sh' is useful for this.
	   [I once had my root fs wiped out -- fortunately it was just
	    a test floppy... Turned out to be a bug in the floppy driver]
	   You'll need to have the file tree from the 0.96 root disk online.
	   If not everything fits, you probably haven't got the shared
	   versions of the executables. If you have >=2 floppy drives, you
	   may want to create a `bare bones' recovery disk and simply use
	   the standard root disk to boot from, then mount the recovery
	   floppy on the other floppy drive. Make sure you put a copy
	   of the root/boot disks in a safe place too.

	8) Make sure you have a good tar program. Check that it
	   supports symbolic links. GNU tar is useful because it
	   adds Volume headers (-V) and multivolume support, but it may
	   not fit on your root disk.
	   
	9) Make the device files [Check tpqic02.h for the minor bits]
		mknod /dev/rmt0 c 12 4		# QIC-24
		mknod /dev/rmt8 c 12 6		# QIC-120
		mknod /dev/rmt16 c 12 8		# QIC-150
		mknod /dev/tape c 12 8		# or whatever appropriate
		mknod /dev/tape-d c 12 `expr 128 + 8`	# ditto
		mknod /dev/tape-reset c 12 255	# for resetting only

	   Make /dev/tape a copy of the device file you prefer as
	   the default device. The names /dev/rmt? are used mainly for
	   historic reasons. (i.e. GNU tar uses them.)
	   The actual major number (now 12) may be different.

	10) insert a blank tape and boot the new kernel.

	11) do a 'mt rewind'. Then the big test:
		tar -cvf /dev/tape /
	    If your fs is slow, the drive will not `stream' continuously.
	    In that case, a buffering program should be used. Unfortunately,
	    that's not available (yet?) for Linux. In the meantime, try:
		tar -b 3000 -cvf /dev/tape /


	12) verify with:
		mt rewind;
		cd /; tar -b 3000 -dvf /dev/tape  [not sure pax can do this]
		[Maybe: ``cd /; tar -cvf - | cmp -'' for pax]

When using tapes, it is important that the tape 'streams', i.e. doesn't
start/stop all the time because that is bad for the tape as well as for
the drive. If you are cursed with a slow hard disk, you should use a large
buffer (-b option for tar) to reduce the starting/stopping.
When doing backups on heavely loaded systems however, you may experience
similar problems. Other *nix variants seem to have special buffering
programs to solve that. Hopefully someone will port those to Linux.

NOTE: The QIC-02 controller will attempt to rewind the tape after
power-on and also after it has been given a reset command. It will
not rewind the tape immediately but instead it will will delay the
rewind until it is given a command that requires actual tape movement.
So, if you don't want any nasty surprises, get used to rewinding the 
tape before/after using it. Otherwise you may insert a tape that has
not been rewound and try to append to the end and discover that your
data has just been overwritten.
The driver sometimes rewinds the tape after reading or writing a file to
the tape. [It should only do this when something goes wrong...] So always
make sure you know the tape position before performing any command that
will write to the tape!

The QIC-02 standard specifies that all drives should support at
least some basic commandset, and specifies some optional
commands as well. I don't know which drives support which optional
commands. Some optional commands are required for certain ioctl
operations. In tpqic02.h you can specify which commands are supported
by your drive using the TP_HAVE_... defines. You could first try it
with all commands enabled and disable the ones that return an 'illegal
command' exception status. The seek-to-end-of-recorded media is particulary
useful as it avoids re-reading the entire tape, but it will only work
correctly if you drive supports it and if there is no data recorded beyond
the end of the most recently written file.

Please send me a note whether it works or not. Try to find out what 
commands are supported by your drive. If I get enough feedback on
this, I will include the TP_HAVEs in the distributed sources.
Bug fixes and suggestions are of course welcome! IF YOU SEND ME A NOTE
ABOUT A PROBLEM OR BUG, MAKE SURE YOU SPECIFY WHAT VERSION OF THE DRIVER,
WHAT VERSION OF LINUX, WHAT KIND OF HARDWARE AND ANY OTHER RELEVANT INFO
YOU HAVE.
The version number of the driver should be printed on-screen when linux
boots.
