# /etc/fstab
# static file system information, see fstab(5)
#
# This file is not used by the kernel, but rather by mount(8), umount(8),
# swapon(8) and swapoff(8).  (Some day fsck(8) will also use this file).
#
# Comment lines have "#" in the first column.  The device field is either
# the name of a block special file or a swap file.  The device and directory
# fields should be absolute pathnames (i.e. start with "/").  Entries that
# are to be ignored should have type "ignore".  Frequency and pass are numeric
# fields for dump(8) and fsck(8) that are not yet used in Linux.  You can
# leave them empty if you want.
#
# Since entries in this file are processed sequentially, file systems must
# appear after the file systems they are mounted on (/usr before /usr/spool).
#
# A sample fstab:
#
# device	directory	type	options			freq pass
#
#/dev/hda1	/		minix	defaults
#/dev/hda2	none		swap	sw
#/dev/hda3	/usr		ext	defaults
#/dev/hda4	/usr/spool	ext	defaults
#/dev/hdb1	/dos		msdos	ro,noexec,nodev
#/dev/fd0	/mnt		minix	ro,nodev,nosuid
#/dev/fd1	none		ignore	xx
#/etc/swapfile	none		swap	swap

/dev/hda1	/		minix	defaults
/dev/hda2	none		swap	sw
/dev/hda3	/usr		ext	defaults
/dev/hda4	/usr/spool	ext	defaults
/dev/hdb1	/dos		msdos	ro,noexec,nodev
/dev/fd0	/mnt		minix	ro,nodev,nosuid
/dev/fd1	none		ignore	xx
/etc/swapfile	none		swap	sw
