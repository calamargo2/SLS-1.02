.Sh NAME
.Nm fstab
.Nd static information about the filesystems
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <fstab.h>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file
.Nm fstab
contains descriptive information about the various file
systems.
.Nm fstab
is only read by programs, and not written;
it is the duty of the system administrator to properly create 
and maintain this file.
Each filesystem is described on a separate line;
fields on each line are separated by tabs or spaces.
The order of records in
.Nm fstab
is important because
.Xr fsck 8 ,
.Xr mount 8 ,
and
.Xr umount 8
sequentially iterate through
.Nm fstab
doing their thing.
.Pp
The first field,
.Pq Fa fs_spec ,
describes the block special device or
remote filesystem to be mounted.
.Pp
The second field,
.Pq Fa fs_file ,
describes the mount point for the filesystem.
For swap partitions, this field should be specified as ``none''.
.Pp
The third field,
.Pq Fa fs_vfstype ,
describes the type of the filesystem.
The system currently supports three types of filesystems:
.Bl -tag -width indent -offset indent
.It Em minix
a local
.Tn Linux
filesystem.
.It Em efs
a local 
.Tn Linux
filesystem with longer filenames and larger inodes.
.It Em msdos
a local
.Tn Linux
filesystem for MS-DOS partitions.
.It Em iso9660
a local
.Tn Linux
filesystem used for CD-ROM drives.
.It Em nfs
a local
.Tn Linux
filesystem for mounting partitions from remote systems.
.It Em swap 
a disk partition to be used for swapping.
.El
.Pp
If
.Fa vfs_fstype
is specified as ``ignore'' the entry is ignored.
This is useful to show disk partitions which are currently unused.
.Pp
The fourth field,
.Pq Fa fs_mntops ,
describes the mount options associated with the filesystem.
.Pp
It is formatted as a comma separated list of options.
It contains at least the type of mount
plus any additional options
appropriate to the filesystem type.
.Pp
The fifth field,
.Pq Fa fs_freq ,
is used for these filesystems by the
.Xr dump 8
command to determine which filesystems need to be dumped.
If the fifth field is not present, a value of zero is returned and
.Xr dump
will assume that the filesystem does not need to be dumped.
.Pp
The sixth field,
.Pq Fa fs_passno ,
is used by the
.Xr fsck 8
program to determine the order in which filesystem checks are done
at reboot time.
The root filesystem should be specified with a
.Fa fs_passno
of 1, and other filesystems should have a 
.Fa fs_passno
of 2.
Filesystems within a drive will be checked sequentially,
but filesystems on different drives will be checked at the
same time to utilize parallelism available in the hardware.
If the sixth field is not present or zero,
a value of zero is returned and
.Xr fsck
will assume that the filesystem does not need to be checked.
.Pp
The proper way to read records from
.Pa fstab
is to use the routines
.Xr getmntent 3 .
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/fstab -compact
.It Pa /etc/fstab
The file
.Nm fstab
resides in
.Pa /etc .
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr getmntent 3
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
file format appeared in
.Bx 4.0 .
