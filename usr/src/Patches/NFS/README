This is a source distribution of sunrpc-4.0 patched for Linux.

It is the RPC (Remote Procedure Call) and XDR (eXternal Data
Represenation) library source.  The original freely distributable
sunrpc was written by Sun Microsystems for BSD systems.  I did not
include any secure_rpc stuff because I don't think it is very widely
used and the secure_rpc distribution didn't include the necessary DES
encrpytion.

I did a fair amount of hacking to get it to work with Linux.  Plus
I fixed a couple of ugly bugs.

The archive includes:

	README			this file
	diffs			my patches to sunrpc-4.0 for linux
	sunrpc/*		the entire patched sunrpc distribution

For installation details and precompiled binaries see the
rcp-bin-4.0.tar.Z distribution.

Enjoy,
