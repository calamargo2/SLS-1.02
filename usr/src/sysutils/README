README: system-0.98.tar.Z

This a collection of various system utilities for Linux that do not
really have another home, but whose source is always being looked for
by people who like to have the source to everything.  Note that I did
not write any of these, but some of them have been modified by me. 

Please send any enhancements, additions, corrections, etc, to me so
they can be incorporated into later releases.
