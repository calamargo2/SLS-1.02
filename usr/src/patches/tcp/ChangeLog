	* ne.c: Added checking for "remote DMA" conflicts caused by
	interrupts occuring even when they aren't enabled(!). Now v53.

	* 8390.[ch]: Added the changes for run-time-selected ping-pong,
	and put in IRQ turn-off conflict checking.  8390.c now v86.

	* wd.c: Added 0x380 and 0x240 to the autoprobe address list.
	Now v86.

	* 3c503.c: Changed the lurking-NE2000-reset code to use offset
	0x**f, since D-Link boards aren't reset at offset 0x**8!  Now v86.

	* 3c503.c: Changed the probe code to do an inb() that will reset
	any lurking NE2000.  Now v85.

	* ne.c: Increased the number of times the rDMA is checked for
	completion, and simplified the hard reset code. Now v51.

	* wd.c: Changed the initial probe to do 'inb(base + 8)' rather
	  than 'inb(base)' so that it isn't trapped by a waiting NE*000
	  data transfer register.  This avoids the hang-on-warm-boot
	  problem for people with NE2000 boards at some locations.

	* 3c503.c: Fixed a mix-up with the new "interface_num" -- the
	  built-in transceiver should be the default (interface 0) rather
	  than the AUI port (now interface 1).
