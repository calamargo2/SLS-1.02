       This manual page explains the ggrrooffff ttmmaacc..aann macro package.
       This macro package should be used by developers when writ-
       ing or porting man pages for Linux.  It is fairly compati-
       ble with other versions of this macro package, so  porting
       man  pages  should  not  be  a  major  problem (exceptions
       include the NET-2 BSD release, which uses a  totally  dif-
       ferent macro package).

PPRREEAAMMBBLLEE
       The first command in a man page should be

              ..TTHH _t_i_t_l_e _s_e_c_t_i_o_n _d_a_t_e _s_o_u_r_c_e _m_a_n_u_a_l,

       where:

              _t_i_t_l_e  is the title of the man page (e.g., _M_A_N),

              _s_e_c_t_i_o_n
                     is the section number the man page should be
                     placed in (e.g., _7),

              _d_a_t_e   is the date of the last revision,

              _s_o_u_r_c_e is related to  the  source  of  the  command
                     (e.g.,  _G_N_U, _N_E_T_-_2, _A_B_C _D_i_s_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_o_n, etc.),
                     and

              _m_a_n_u_a_l is the title of the manual (e.g., _L_i_n_u_x _P_r_o_-
                     _g_r_a_m_m_e_r_'_s _M_a_n_u_a_l).

       The manual sections are traditionally defined as follows:

              1      Commands  (e.g.,  those commands that can be
                     executed by the user from within a shell)

              2      System calls (e.g.,  those  functions  which
                     must be performed by the kernel)

              3      Library  calls (e.g., most of the _l_i_b_c func-
                     tions, such as _s_o_r_t_(_3_))

              4      Special files (e.g., files found in _/_d_e_v)

              5      File formats and conventions (e.g., the for-
                     mat for _/_e_t_c_/_p_a_s_s_w_d)

              6      Games

              7      Macro  packages  and  conventions  (e.g.,  a
                     description of the standard file system lay-
                     out, and this man page)

              8      System  management  commands (e.g., commands
                     like _m_o_u_n_t(8), which only _r_o_o_t can execute)

              9      Kernel routines (this is a non-standard man-
                     ual  section  and  is  included  because the
                     source code to the Linux  kernel  is  freely
                     available  under  the GNU Public License and
                     many people are working on  changes  to  the
                     kernel)

FFOONNTTSS
       In some conventions, command names and options are in bboolldd
       ffaaccee, file names and variable names are  in  _i_t_a_l_i_c_s,  and
       the  rest  of  the  text  is  in Roman.  Other conventions
       reverse the use of bold  and  italics.   In  general,  you
       should try to make your usage consistent throughout a doc-
       ument.  The commands to select the  type  face  are  given
       below:

       ..BB     Bold

       ..BBII    Bold alternating with italics

       ..BBRR    Bold alternating with Roman

       ..II     Italics

       ..IIBB    Italics alternating with bold

       ..IIRR    Italics alternating with Roman

       ..RRBB    Roman alternating with bold

       ..RRII    Roman alternating with italics

       ..SSBB    Small alternating with bold

       ..SSMM    Small

       Traditionally,  each command can have up to six arguments,
       but the GNU  version  seems  to  remove  this  limitation.
       Arguments  are  delimited by spaces.  Double quotes can be
       used to specify an argument which contains spaces.  All of
       the  arguments  will be printed next to each other without
       intervening spaces, so that the ..BBRR command can be used to

       specify  a  word in bold followed by a mark of punctuation
       in Roman.

SSEECCTTIIOONNSS
       Sections are started with  ..SSHH  followed  by  the  heading
       name.  If the name contains spaces and appears on the same
       line as ..SSHH, then place  the  heading  in  double  quotes.
       Traditional headings include: NAME, SYNOPSIS, DESCRIPTION,
       OPTIONS, FILES, SEE ALSO, DIAGNOSTICS, BUGS,  and  AUTHOR.
       The  only  required  heading is _N_A_M_E, which should be fol-
       lowed on the next line by a one line  description  of  the
       program:

              .SH NAME
              chess \- the game of chess

       It  is  extremely  important that this format is followed,
       and that there is a backslash before the single dash which
       follows  the  command  name.   This  syntax is used by the
       mmaakkeewwhhaattiiss(8) program to create a database of  short  com-
       mand  descriptions  for  the wwhhaattiiss(1) and aapprrooppooss(1) com-
       mands.

OOTTHHEERR MMAACCRROOSS
       Other macros include the following:

       ..DDTT    Default tabs

       ..HHPP    Begin hanging indent

       ..IIPP    Begin paragraph with hanging tag.  This is the same
              as  ..TTPP,  except the tag is given on the same line,
              not on the following line.

       ..LLPP    Same as ..PPPP

       ..PPDD    Set interparagraph distance to argument

       ..PPPP    Begin a new paragraph

       ..RREE    End relative indent (indented paragraph)

       ..RRSS    Start relative indent (indented paragraph)

       ..SSSS    Subheading (like ..SSHH, but used for a subsection)

       ..TTPP    Begin paragraph with hanging tag.  The tag is given
              on the next line.  This command is similar to ..IIPP
