       gettydefs - speed and tty settings used by getty

       The  file  //eettcc//ggeettttyyddeeffss  contains  information  used  by
       _g_e_t_t_y(1m) to set up the speed and tty settings for a line.
       It  supplies  information  on what the _l_o_g_i_n_-_p_r_o_m_p_t should
       look like.  It also supplies the speed to try next if  the
       user  indicates the current speed is not correct by typing
       a _<_b_r_e_a_k_> character.

       Each entry in //eettcc//ggeettttyyddeeffss has the following :

         label# initial-flags # final-flags # login-prompt #next-label

       Each entry is followed by a blank line.  Lines that  begin
       with  ##  are  ignored and may be used to comment the file.
       The various fields can contain quoted  characters  of  the
       form  \\bb,  \\nn, \\cc, etc., as well as \\_n_n_n, where _n_n_n is the
       octal value of the desired character.  The various  fields
       are:

       _l_a_b_e_l           This  is  the  string  against which _g_e_t_t_y
                       tries to match its second argument. It  is
                       often  the  speed,  such as 11220000, at which
                       the terminal is supposed to  run,  but  it
                       needn't be (see below).

       _i_n_i_t_i_a_l_-_f_l_a_g_s   These  flags are the initial _i_o_c_t_l(2) set-
                       tings to which the terminal is to  be  set
                       if  a  terminal  type  is not specified to
                       _g_e_t_t_y.   _G_e_t_t_y  understands  the  symbolic
                       names  specified  in //uussrr//iinncclluuddee//tteerrmmiioo..hh
                       (see _t_e_r_m_i_o(7)).  Normally only the  speed
                       flag  is  required  in  the  _i_n_i_t_i_a_l_-_f_l_a_g_s
                       field.  _G_e_t_t_y automatically sets the  ter-
                       minal  to raw input mode and takes care of
                       most of the other flags.  The _i_n_i_t_i_a_l_-_f_l_a_g
                       settings remain in effect until _g_e_t_t_y exe-
                       cutes _l_o_g_i_n(1m).

       _f_i_n_a_l_-_f_l_a_g_s     These flags take the same  values  as  the
                       _i_n_i_t_i_a_l_-_f_l_a_g_s  and  are  set just prior to
                       _g_e_t_t_y executes ..  The speed flag is  again
                       required.   The  composite flag SSAANNEE takes
                       care of most of the other flags that  need
                       to be set so that the processor and termi-
                       nal are communicating in a rational  fash-
                       ion.   The  other  two  commonly specified
                       _f_i_n_a_l_-_f_l_a_g_s are TTAABB33,  so  that  tabs  are
                       sent to the terminal as spaces, and HHUUPPCCLL,
                       so that the line is hung up on  the  final
                       close.




                                                                1

       _l_o_g_i_n_-_p_r_o_m_p_t    This entire field is printed as the _l_o_g_i_n_-
                       _p_r_o_m_p_t.  Unlike  the  above  fields  where
                       white  space  is  ignored (a space, tab or
                       new-line), they are included in the _l_o_g_i_n_-
                       _p_r_o_m_p_t field.

                       The _l_o_g_i_n_-_p_r_o_m_p_t may contain various @@_c_h_a_r
                       and \\_c_h_a_r parameters.  These are described
                       in  full  in  the _g_e_t_t_y(1m) section PROMPT
                       SUBSTITUTIONS.

       _n_e_x_t_-_l_a_b_e_l      This indicates the next _l_a_b_e_l of the entry
                       in  the table that _g_e_t_t_y should use if the
                       user types a _<_b_r_e_a_k_> or the  input  cannot
                       be  read.  Usually, a series of speeds are
                       linked together in this  fashion,  into  a
                       closed  set.  For instance, 22440000 linked to
                       11220000, which in  turn  is  linked  to  330000,
                       which finally is linked back to 22440000.

       If  _g_e_t_t_y  is  called  without  a _s_p_e_e_d argument, then the
       first entry of //eettcc//ggeettttyyddeeffss is  used,  thus  making  the
       first  entry  of  //eettcc//ggeettttyyddeeffss  the default entry. It is
       also used if _g_e_t_t_y can't find  the  specified  _l_a_b_e_l_.   If
       //eettcc//ggeettttyyddeeffss itself is missing, there is one entry built
       into _g_e_t_t_y which will bring up a terminal at 9600 baud.

       It is strongly recommended that after making or  modifying
       //eettcc//ggeettttyyddeeffss,  it  be  run  through _g_e_t_t_y with the check
       (--cc) option to be sure there are no errors.
