     The file ffssttaabb contains descriptive information about the various file
     systems.  ffssttaabb is only read by programs, and not written; it is the duty
     of the system administrator to properly create and maintain this file.
     Each filesystem is described on a separate line; fields on each line are
     separated by tabs or spaces.  The order of records in ffssttaabb is important
     because fsck(8),  mount(8),  and umount(8) sequentially iterate through
     ffssttaabb doing their thing.

     The first field, (_f_s___s_p_e_c), describes the block special device or remote
     filesystem to be mounted.

     The second field, (_f_s___f_i_l_e), describes the mount point for the filesys-
     tem.  For swap partitions, this field should be specified as ``none''.

     The third field, (_f_s___v_f_s_t_y_p_e), describes the type of the filesystem.  The
     system currently supports three types of filesystems:

           _m_i_n_i_x   a local UNIX filesystem

           _e_f_s     a local UNIX filesystem with longer filenames and larger
                   inodes.

           _s_w_a_p    a disk partition to be used for swapping.

     If _v_f_s___f_s_t_y_p_e is specified as ``ignore'' the entry is ignored.  This is
     useful to show disk partitions which are currently unused.

     The fourth field, (_f_s___m_n_t_o_p_s), describes the mount options associated
     with the filesystem.

     It is formatted as a comma separated list of options.  It contains at
     least the type of mount plus any additional options appropriate to the
     filesystem type.

     The fifth field, (_f_s___f_r_e_q), is used for these filesystems by the dump(8)
     command to determine which filesystems need to be dumped.  If the fifth
     field is not present, a value of zero is returned and dump will assume
     that the filesystem does not need to be dumped.

     The sixth field, (_f_s___p_a_s_s_n_o), is used by the fsck(8) program to determine
     the order in which filesystem checks are done at reboot time.  The root
     filesystem should be specified with a _f_s___p_a_s_s_n_o of 1, and other filesys-
     tems should have a _f_s___p_a_s_s_n_o of 2.  Filesystems within a drive will be
     checked sequentially, but filesystems on different drives will be checked
     at the same time to utilize parallelism available in the hardware.  If
     the sixth field is not present or zero, a value of zero is returned and
     fsck will assume that the filesystem does not need to be checked.

     The proper way to read records from _f_s_t_a_b is to use the routines
     getmntent(3).
