Files output by consist of a header line, followed by a number of
body lines, and a trailer line.   The  command  will  ignore  any
lines  preceding the header or following the trailer.  Lines pre-
ceding a header must not, of course, look  like  a  header.   The
header line is distinguished by having the first 6 characters The
word is followed by a mode (in octal), and a string  which  names
the remote file.  A space separates the three items in the header
line.  The body consists of a number of lines, each  at  most  62
characters  long (including the trailing newline).  These consist
of a character count, followed by encoded characters, followed by
a  newline.   The character count is a single printing character,
and represents an integer, the number of bytes the  rest  of  the
line represents.  Such integers are always in the range from 0 to
63 and can be  determined  by  subtracting  the  character  space
(octal 40) from the character.  Groups of 3 bytes are stored in 4
characters, 6 bits per character.  All are offset by a  space  to
make  the characters printing.  The last line may be shorter than
the normal 45 bytes.  If the size is not a multiple  of  3,  this
fact  can  be  determined  by  the value of the count on the last
line.  Extra garbage will be included to make the character count
a  multiple  of 4.  The body is terminated by a line with a count
of zero.  This line consists of one space.  The trailer line con-
sists of on a line by itself.  The file format appeared in
