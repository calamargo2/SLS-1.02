       _g_e_t_t_y  opens  a  tty  port,  prompts  for a login name and
       invokes the /bin/login command. It is normally invoked  by
       _i_n_i_t_(_8_).

       _g_e_t_t_y  has  several  _n_o_n_-_s_t_a_n_d_a_r_d features that are useful
       for hard-wired and for dial-in lines:

       o      Adapts the tty  settings  to  parity  bits  and  to
              erase,  kill,  end-of-line and uppercase characters
              when it reads a login name.  The program can handle
              7-bit characters with even, odd, none or space par-
              ity, and 8-bit characters with no parity. The  fol-
              lowing  special  characters  are  recognized: @ and
              Control-U (kill); #, DEL and  back  space  (erase);
              carriage return and line feed (end of line).

       o      Optionally  deduces  the baud rate from the CONNECT
              messages produced by Hayes(tm)-compatible modems.

       o      Optionally does not hang up when  it  is  given  an
              already  opened line (useful for call-back applica-
              tions).

       o      Optionally does not display  the  contents  of  the
              _/_e_t_c_/_i_s_s_u_e file (System V only).

       o      Optionally  invokes  a  non-standard  login program
              instead of _/_b_i_n_/_l_o_g_i_n.

       o      Optionally turns on hard-ware flow control (SunOS 4
              only).

       This program does not use the _/_e_t_c_/_g_e_t_t_y_d_e_f_s (System V) or
       _/_e_t_c_/_g_e_t_t_y_t_a_b (SunOS 4) files.

AARRGGUUMMEENNTTSS
       port   A path name relative to the _/_d_e_v  directory.  If  a
              "-"  is  specified, _g_e_t_t_y assumes that its standard
              input is already connected to a tty port and that a
              connection to a remote user has already been estab-
              lished.

              Under System V, a "-" _p_o_r_t argument should be  pre-
              ceded by a "--".



                                                                1

       baud_rate,...
              A  comma-separated  list of one or more baud rates.
              Each time  _g_e_t_t_y  receives  a  BREAK  character  it
              advances  through  the list, which is treated as if
              it were circular.

              Baud rates should be specified in descending order,
              so  that  the  null  character (Ctrl-@) can also be
              used for baud rate switching.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       -h (SunOS 4 only)
              Enable hardware (RTS/CTS) flow control. It is  left
              up   to   the   application   to  disable  software
              (XON/XOFF) flow protocol where appropriate.

       -i (System V only)
              Do not display the contents  of  _/_e_t_c_/_i_s_s_u_e  before
              writing  the  login prompt. Terminals or communica-
              tions hardware may become confused  when  receiving
              lots  of  text  at  the  wrong  baud  rate; dial-up
              scripts may fail if the login prompt is preceded by
              too much text.

       -l login_program
              Invoke   the  specified  _l_o_g_i_n___p_r_o_g_r_a_m  instead  of
              /bin/login.  This allows the use of a  non-standard
              login  program  (for  example,  one that asks for a
              dial-up password or that uses a different  password
              file).

       -m     Try  to  extract  the  baud rate the _c_o_n_n_e_c_t status
              message  produced  by   some   Hayes(tm)-compatible
              modems.  These  status  messages  are  of the form:
              "<junk><speed><junk>".   _g_e_t_t_y  assumes  that   the
              modem emits its status message at the same speed as
              specified with (the first) _b_a_u_d___r_a_t_e value  on  the
              command line.

              Since  the  _-_m  feature  may fail on heavily-loaded
              systems, you still should enable  BREAK  processing
              by  enumerating all expected baud rates on the com-
              mand line.

       -t timeout
              Terminate if no user  name  could  be  read  within
              _t_i_m_e_o_u_t seconds. This option should probably not be
              used with hard-wired lines.

       For a dial-in line with a 2400/1200/300 baud modem:
            t1:2:respawn:/bin/getty -mt60 ttyM1 2400,1200,300

       This section show sample entries for the _/_e_t_c_/_t_t_y_t_a_b file.
       Note  that  init(8)  appends  the port name to the command
       specified in the inittab file.

       For a hard-wired line:
            ttya  "/bin/getty 9600"  vt100  on local

       For a dial-in line with a 2400/1200/300 baud modem:
            ttyb  "/bin/getty -mt60 2400,1200,300"   unknown   on
       modem

       The latter also requires that the _D_T_R and _C_D modem control
       lines are enabled (see the eeprom(8) manual page).

FFIILLEESS
       /etc/utmp, the system status file (System V only).
       /etc/issue, printed before the login prompt (System V only).
       /dev/console, problem reports (if syslog(3) is not used).
       /etc/inittab (System V init(8) configuration file).
       /etc/ttytab (SunOS 4 init(8) configuration file).

BBUUGGSS
       The baud-rate detection feature (the _-_m  option)  requires
       that  _g_e_t_t_y be scheduled soon enough after completion of a
       dial-in call (within 30 ms with modems that talk  at  2400
       baud).  For robustness, always use the _-_m option in combi-
       nation with a multiple baud rate command-line argument, so
       that BREAK processing is enabled.

       The  text  in  the /etc/issue file (System V only) and the
       login prompt are always output with 7-bit  characters  and
       space parity.

       The  baud-rate  detection feature (the _-_m option) requires
       that the modem emits its status message _a_f_t_e_r raising  the
       DCD line.

DDIIAAGGNNOOSSTTIICCSS
       Depending  on how the program was configured, all diagnos-
       tics are written to the console device or reported via the
       syslog(3)  facility.   Error  messages are produced if the
       _p_o_r_t argument does not specify a terminal device; if there
       is  no  /etc/utmp  entry for the current process (System V
       only); and so on.
