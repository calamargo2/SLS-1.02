     The mmoouunntt command calls the mount(2) system call to prepare and graft a
     _s_p_e_c_i_a_l device on to the file system tree at the point _n_o_d_e_. If either
     _s_p_e_c_i_a_l or _n_o_d_e are not provided, the appropriate information is taken
     from the fstab(5) file.

     The system maintains a list of currently mounted file systems.  If no ar-
     guments are given to mmoouunntt,, this list is printed.

     Options available for the mmoouunntt command:

     --ff      Causes everything to be done except for the actual system call;
             if it's not obvious, this ``fakes'' mounting the file system.
             This option is useful in conjunction with the --vv flag to deter-
             mine what the mmoouunntt command is trying to do.

     --oo      Options are specified with a --oo flag followed by a comma separat-
             ed string of options.  The following options apply to any file
             system that is being mounted:

             noexec  Do not allow execution of any binaries on the mounted
                     file system.  This options is useful for a server that
                     has file systems containing binaries for architectures
                     other than its own.

             nosuid  Do not allow set-user-identifier or set-group-identifier
                     bits to take effect.

             nodev   Do not interpret character or block special devices on
                     the file system.  This options is useful for a server
                     that has file systems containing special devices for ar-
                     chitectures other than its own.

             synchronous
                     All I/O to the file system should be done synchronously.

     --rr      The file system object is to be mounted read-only.

     --tt _m_i_n_i_x | _e_x_t | _m_s_d_o_s
             The argument following the --tt is used to indicate the file system
             type.  The type _m_i_n_i_x is the default.  For example, the mmoouunntt
             command:

                   mount -a -t nomsdos,ext

             mounts all filesystems except those of type msdos and ext.

     --uu      The --uu flag indicates that the status of an already mounted file
             system should be changed.  Any of the options discussed above
             (the --oo option) may be changed; also a file system can be changed
             from read-only to read-write.  The set of options is determined
             by first extracting the options for the file system from the
             fstab table, then applying any options specified by the --oo argu-
             ment, and finally applying the --rr or --ww option.

     --vv      Verbose mode.

     --ww      The file system object is to be read and write.

     UUmmoouunntt removes the _s_p_e_c_i_a_l device grafted at point _n_o_d_e from file system
     tree.

     Options for the uummoouunntt command:

     --aa      All of the file systems described in fstab are unmounted.

     --tt      Is used to indicate the actions should only be taken on filesys-
             tems of the specified type.  More than one type may be specified
             in a comma separated list.  The list of filesystem types can be
             prefixed with ``no'' to specify the filesystem types on which no
             action should be taken.  (See example above for the mmoouunntt com-
             mand.)

BBUUGGSS
     It is possible for a corrupted file system to cause a crash.

     Linux doesn't support --uu or --oo synchronous yet.
