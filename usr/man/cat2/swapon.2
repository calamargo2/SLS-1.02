       sswwaappoonn(())  sets  the  swap area to the file or block device
       specified  by _*_f_i_l_e_.

       sswwaappoonn(()) may only be called by the  super  user,  and  may
       only  be  called once successfully.  0 is returned on suc-
       cess, and a pprriinnttkk(()) (console message)  made  telling  how
       much  swap  space was added.  On failure, a negative value
       is returned.

EERRRROORRSS
       --EEBBUUSSYY is returned when there already is a  swap  file  or
       swap device.

       --EEIINNVVAALL is returned if _f_i_l_e exists, but is neither a regu-
       lar file nor a block device.

       --EENNOOEENNTT is returned if _f_i_l_e does not exist.

       --EENNOOMMEEMM is returned if there  is  insufficient  memory  to
       start  swapping.   --EEPPEERRMM  is  returned  if non-root users
       attempt to call sswwaappoonn(())..

       There is no way to turn off swapping  or  change  devices.
       The partition or file must be prepared with mkswap(1).
