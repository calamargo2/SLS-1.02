       rreeaadd(())  attempts  to  read  _c_o_u_n_t  bytes   from  open file
       descriptor _f_i_l_e_d_e_s , storing them in the  memory  location
       pointed  to by _b_u_f wwrriittee(()) works in the same fashion, only
       the bytes are written to the file  descriptor.   rreeaadd  and
       wwrriittee(())  return the number of bytes successfully read from
       or written to the file descriptor, 0 on EOF, and  a  nega-
       tive number on any other error condition.

EERRRROORRSS
       0 is returned on EOF

       --EEBBAADDFF  is  returned when an invalid _f_i_l_e_d_e_s was used, the
       file was opened read only and a write  was  attempted,  or
       the file was opened write only and a read was attempted.

       --EEIINNVVAALL  is returned when the ii__mmooddee field of the inode is
       invalid.
