       mmoouunntt(())  mounts  the  filesystem on the block device named
       _*_d_e_v_n_a_m_e onto the directory _d_i_r_n_a_m_e

       uummoouunntt(()) unmounts the specified block device.

       0 is returned on success, a negative value on error.

       --EEBBUUSSYY is returned under the following conditions:

       1.     There is activity in the directory you  are  trying
              to mount on

       2.     You are attempting to mount on /.

       3.     There  is file system activity during umount, which
              could be as simple as a process having a  directory
              under the mount point as wd.

       --EENNOOEENNTT  is returned if the block device or directory does
       not exist.

       --EENNOOTTBBLLKK is returned if you attempt to unmount a non-block
       device.

       --EEPPEERRMM is returned under the following conditions:

       1.     You attempt to mount a non-block device.

       2.     You attempt to mount on a non-directory.

       3.     The filesystem is already mounted.

       non-super users may make mmoouunntt(()) and uummoouunntt(()) calls.

       It  is  impossible  to mount over root, as with BSD.  This
       can be considered a feature or misfeature depending on you

       you  look at it - as root will always be busy and probably
       shouldn't be mounted over.

       EEBBUUSSYY,, EENNOOTTBBLLKK,, and EEPPEERRMM may be confused in some  places.
