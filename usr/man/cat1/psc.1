       _P_s_c is used to prepare data for input to the spread  sheet
       calculator  _s_c_(_1_)_.   It accepts normal ascii data on stan-
       dard input.  Standard  output  is  a  _s_c  file.   With  no
       options,  _p_s_c starts the spread sheet in cell A0.  Strings
       are right justified.  All data on a line is entered on the
       same  row;  new input lines cause the output row number to
       increment by one.  The  default  delimiters  are  tab  and
       space.   The column formats are set to one larger than the
       number of columns required to hold the  largest  value  in
       the column.

       Options:


       -L     Left justify strings.


       -k     Keep all delimiters.  This option causes the output
              cell to change on each new delimiter encountered in
              the  input  stream.   The default action is to con-
              dense multiple delimters to one, so that  the  cell
              only changes once per input data item.


       -r     Output  the  data  by  row  first then column.  For
              input consisting of a single  column,  this  option
              will  result  in  output  of  one row with multiple
              columns instead of a single column spread sheet.


       -s cell
              Start the top left corner of the  spread  sheet  in
              _c_e_l_l_.   For example, _-_s _B_3_3 will arrange the output
              data so that the spread sheet starts in  column  B,
              row 33.


       -R n   Increment by _n on each new output row.


       -C n   Increment by _n on each new output column.


       -n n   Output  _n rows before advancing to the next column.
              This option is used when the input is arranged in a



                                                                1

              single  column and the spread sheet is to have mul-
              tiple columns, each of which is to be length _n_.


       -d c   Use the single character _c as the delimiter between
              input fields.
