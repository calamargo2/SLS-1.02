       This manual page  documents  the  GNU  version  of  uunnaammee.
       uunnaammee  prints  information about the machine and operating
       system it is run on.  If no options are given, uunnaammee  acts
       as  if  the _-_s option were given.  If multiple options are
       given or the _-_a option is given, the selected  information
       is  printed  in  the  order  `snrvm'  with a space between
       items.

       The long-named options can be introduced with `+' as  well
       as  `--', for compatibility with previous releases.  Even-
       tually support for `+' will  be  removed,  because  it  is
       incompatible with the POSIX.2 standard.
