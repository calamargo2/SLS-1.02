filters  out  reverse (and half reverse) line feeds so the output
is in the correct order with only forward and half  forward  line
feeds, and replaces white-space characters with tabs where possi-
ble.  This can be useful in processing the output  of  and  reads
from  standard  input and writes to standard output.  The options
are as follows: Do not output any backspaces, printing  only  the
last  character  written  to  each column position.  Forward half
line feeds are permitted (``fine''  mode).   Normally  characters
printed  on  a  half  line  boundary are printed on the following
line.  Output multiple spaces instead of tabs.  Buffer  at  least
lines  in  memory.  By default, 128 lines are buffered.  The con-
trol sequences for carriage motion  that  understands  and  their
decimal  values  are  listed in the following table: reverse line
feed (escape then 7) half reverse line feed (escape then 8)  half
forward  line  feed  (escape  then  9) moves back one column (8);
ignored in the first column (13) forward  line  feed  (10);  also
does  carriage return shift to normal character set (15) shift to
alternate character set (14) moves forward one column (32)  moves
forward  to next tab stop (9) reverse line feed (11) All unrecog-
nized control characters  and  escape  sequences  are  discarded.
keeps track of the character set as characters are read and makes
sure the character set is correct when they are output.   If  the
input  attempts to back up to the last flushed line, will display
a warning message.  A command appeared in Version 6 AT&T UNIX.
