NAME
     ranlib-generate index to archive.


SYNOPSIS
     ranlib _a_r_c_h_i_v_e

DESCRIPTION
     ranlib generates an index to the contents of an archive, and
     stores  it  in the archive.  The index lists each symbol de-
     fined by a member of an archive that is a relocatable object
     file.

     You may use `nm -s' or `nm +print-armap' to list this index.

     An archive with such an index speeds up linking to  the  li-
     brary, and allows routines in the library to call each other
     without regard to their placement in the archive.

     The GNU ranlib program is another form of  GNU  ar;  running
     ranlib is completely equivalent to executing `ar -s'.
