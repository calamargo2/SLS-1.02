       _e_l_v_p_r_s_v preserves your edited text after _e_l_v_i_s dies.   The
       text can be recovered later, via the _e_l_v_p_r_s_v program.

       For  UNIX-like  systems, you should never need to run this
       program from the command line.  It  is  run  automatically
       when  _e_l_v_i_s  is  about  to  die, and it should be run (via
       /etc/rc) when the computer is booted.  THAT'S ALL!

       For non-UNIX systems such as MS-DOS, you  can  either  use
       _e_l_v_p_r_s_v  the same way as under UNIX systems (by running it
       from your AUTOEXEC.BAT file), or you can run it separately
       with the "-R" flag to recover the files in one step.

       If  you're  editing  a file when _e_l_v_i_s dies (due to a bug,
       system crash, power failure, etc.)  then _e_l_v_p_r_s_v will pre-
       serve the most recent version of your text.  The preserved
       text is stored in a special directory; it does  NOT  over-
       write your text file automatically.

       _e_l_v_p_r_s_v  will  send  mail  to  any user whose work it pre-
       serves, if your operating system normally supports mail.

FFIILLEESS
       /tmp/elv*
              The temporary file that _e_l_v_i_s  was  using  when  it
              died.

       /usr/preserve/p*
              The text that is preserved by _e_l_v_p_r_s_v.

       /usr/preserve/Index
              A  text file which lists the names of all preserved
              files, and the names of the /usr/preserve/p*  files
              which contain their preserved text.

BBUUGGSS
       Due  to the permissions on the /usr/preserve directory, on
       UNIX systems _e_l_v_p_r_s_v must be run as  superuser.   This  is
       accomplished  by making the _e_l_v_p_r_s_v executable be owned by
       "root" and turning on its "set user id" bit.

       If you're editing a nameless buffer when _e_l_v_i_s dies,  then
       _e_l_v_p_r_s_v will pretend that the file was named "foo".
