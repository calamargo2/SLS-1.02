       NNeewwggrrpp  changes  the  group  identification of its caller,
       analogously to _l_o_g_i_n_(_1_).  The same person  remains  logged
       in,  and  the current directory is unchanged, but calcula-
       tions of access permissions to files  are  performed  with
       respect to the new group ID.

       If  no group is specified, the GID is changed to the login
       GID.

       NNeewwggrrpp is known to the shell, which executes  it  directly
       without a fork.
