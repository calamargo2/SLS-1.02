DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       _X_d_v_i is a program which runs under the X window system. It
       is used to preview DVI files, such as are produced by TeX.

       This program  has  the  capability  of  showing  the  file
       shrunken  by  various  (integer)  factors,  and also has a
       ``magnifying glass'' which allows one to see a small  part
       of the unshrunk image momentarily.

       Before  displaying  any page or part thereof, it checks to
       see if the dvi file has changed since the last time it was
       displayed.  If this is the case, then _x_d_v_i will reinitial-
       ize itself for the new dvi file.  For this reason,  expos-
       ing  parts  of the _x_d_v_i window while _T_e_X is running should
       be avoided.  This feature allows you to preview many  ver-
       sions of the same file while running _x_d_v_i only once.

       In  addition  to using keystrokes to move within the file,
       _x_d_v_i provides buttons on the right  side  of  the  window,
       which are synonymous with various sequences of keystrokes.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       In addition to specifying the .ddvvii file (with  or  without
       the  .ddvvii),  _X_d_v_i  supports the following command line op-
       tions.  If the option begins with a `++' instead of a  `--',
       #ifx11  the  option  is restored to its default value.  By
       default, these options can be set via the  resource  names
       given  in  parentheses  in the description of each option.
       #ifx10 the option is restored to its default value.  These
       options override those set in the ``.Xdefaults'' file (via
       the resource names given in parentheses in the description
       of each option).  #endif

       _+ppaaggee  Specifies  the  first  page to show.  If _+ is given
              without a number, the last  page  is  assumed;  the
              first page is the default.

       --tthhoorroouugghh
              (.thorough)  _X_d_v_i  will  usually try to ensure that
              overstrike characters (_e_._g_.   \notin)  are  printed
              correctly.   On monochrome displays, this is always
              possible with one logical operation, either _a_n_d  or
              _o_r.   On color displays, however, this may take two
              operations, one to set the appropriate bits and one
              to  clear other bits.  If this is the case, then by
              default _x_d_v_i will instead use the  _c_o_p_y  operation,
              which  does not handle overstriking correctly.  The
              ``thorough'' option chooses  the  slower  but  more
              correct choice.  See also _-_c_o_p_y, below.

       --ccooppyy  (.copy)  Always use the _c_o_p_y operation when writing
              characters to the display.  This option may be nec-
              essary  for  correct  operation on a color display,
              but overstrike characters will be incorrect.

       --kkeeeepp  (.keepPosition) Sets a flag to indicate  that  _x_d_v_i
              should not move to the home position when moving to
              a new page.  See also the `k' keystroke.

              number  optionally  followed  by "cm", e.g., 1.5 or
              3cm, giving a measurement in inches or centimeters.
              It  determines  the  ``home''  position of the page
              within the window as follows.  If the  entire  page
              fits  in  the  window, then the margin settings are
              ignored.  If, even after removing the margins  from
              the  left,  right,  top, and bottom, the page still
              cannot fit in the window, then the page is  put  in
              the  window  such that the top and left margins are
              hidden, and presumably the upper  left-hand  corner
              of  the text on the page will be in the upper left-
              hand corner of the window.  Otherwise, the text  is
              centered  in  the  window.   See also `MM' under the

              izontal  and  vertical offsets of the output on the
              page.  This should be a decimal  number  optionally
              followed  by  "cm", e.g., 1.5 or 3cm, giving a mea-
              surement in inches or centimeters.   By  decree  of
              the Stanford TeX Project, the default TeX page ori-
              gin is always 1 inch over and down  from  the  top-
              left  page  corner,  even  when  non-American paper
              sizes are used.  Therefore, the default offsets are

              where _w is the width in inches (or cm) and _h is the
              height in inches (or cm), respectively.  There  are
              also  synonyms which may be used:  us (8.5x11), usr
              (11x8.5), legal (8.5x14),  foolscap  (13.5x17),  as

       ll      Moves left two thirds of a windowfull.

       rr      Moves right two thirds of a windowfull.

       cc      Moves  the page so that the point currently beneath
              the cursor is moved to the middle  of  the  window.
              It also (gasp!) warps the cursor to the same place.

       MM      Sets the margins so that the point currently  under
              the  cursor  is  the  upper left-hand corner of the
              text in the page.  Note that  this  command  itself
              does not move the image at all.  For details on how
              the margins are used, see the -mmaarrggiinnss option.

       ss      Changes the shrink factor to the given number.   If
              no  number is given, the smallest factor that makes
              the entire page fit in the  window  will  be  used.
              (Margins are ignored in this computation.)

       SS      Sets  the  density factor to be used when shrinking
              bitmaps.  This should be a  number  between  0  and
              100; higher numbers produce lighter characters.

       RR      Forces  the dvi file to be reread.  This allows you
              to preview many versions of  the  same  file  while

              running _x_d_v_i only once.

       kk      Normally  when _x_d_v_i switches pages, it moves to the
              home position as well.  The `k' keystroke toggles a
              `keep-position' flag which, when set, will keep the
              same position when moving between pages.  Also `0k'
              and  `1k'  clear  and  set this flag, respectively.
              See also the --kkeeeepp option.

       xx      Toggles expert mode (in which the  buttons  do  not
              appear).   Also  `0x' and `1x' clear and reset this
              mode, respectively.  See also the --eexxppeerrtt option.

       If the shrink factor is set to any number other than  one,
       then  clicking any mouse button will pop up a ``magnifying
       glass'' which shows the unshrunk image in the vicinity  of
       the mouse click.  This subwindow disappears when the mouse
       button is released.  Different mouse buttons produce  dif-
       ferent  sized  windows,  as  indicated by the --mmggss option.
       Moving the cursor while holding the button down will  move
       the magnifying glass.

       Also,  the  scrollbars (if present) behave in the standard
       way:  pushing Button 2 in a scrollbar  moves  the  top  or
       left  edge  of  the scrollbar to that point and optionally
       drags it; pushing Button 1 moves the image up or right  by
       an  amount  equal to the distance from the button press to
       the upper left-hand corner of the window; pushing Button 3
       moves the image down or left by the same amount.

       Uses the environment variable ``DISPLAY'' to specify which
       bit map display terminal to use.

       _X_d_v_i uses the same environment  variables  and  algorithms
       for finding font files as TeX and its friends do.  The de-
       fault paths are listed below.  The  environment  variables
       TEXFONTS,  PKFONTS,  TEXPKS,  and GFFONTS override the de-
       faults.  A leading or trailing  colon  in  an  environment
       variable value is replaced by the default.

       Specifically,  a GF file is looked for along GFFONTS, then
       TEXFONTS; a PK file along PKFONTS, then TEXPKS, then  TEX-
       FONTS.

       In  either  the  default value or the environment variable
       value, if a component ends with two slashes, all subdirec-
       tories of the given directory are searched.

       The  ``XDVISIZES''  variable  can be set to indicate which
       sizes of fonts are available.  It should consist of a list
       of  numbers  separated  by  colons.  A leading or trailing
       colon  is  replaced  by  the  default  size  list,   %%DE-

       Sizes are expressed in dots per inch; decimals may be used
       for ``pxl'' files: for example, a 300 dots per  inch  file
       magnified  by  half a step comes out to 1643 dots per five
       inches, which should be encoded as 328.6.

       _x_d_v_i tries the font size actually requested before  trying
       any of the given sizes.
