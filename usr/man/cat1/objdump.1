NAME
     objdump-display information from object files.


SYNOPSIS
     objdump
          [-a] [-b _b_f_d_n_a_m_e] [-d] [-f] [-h|+header] [-i]
          [-j _s_e_c_t_i_o_n] [-l] [-m _m_a_c_h_i_n_e] [-r|+reloc] [-s]
          [-t|+syms] [-x] _o_b_j_f_i_l_e_s...

DESCRIPTION
     objdump displays information about one or more object files.
     The  options control what particular information to display.
     This information is mostly useful  to  programmers  who  are
     working  on the compilation tools, as opposed to programmers
     who just want their program to compile and work.

OPTIONS
     Where long and short forms of an option are shown  together,
     they are equivalent.


     _o_b_j_f_i_l_e_s...
          The object files to be examined.  When you specify  ar-
          chives, objdump shows information on each of the member
          object files.


     -a   If any files from _o_b_j_f_i_l_e_s are  archives,  display  the
          archive  header information (in a format similar to `ls
          -l').  Besides the information you could list with  `ar
          tv',  `objdump -a' shows the object file format of each
          archive member.


     -b _b_f_d_n_a_m_e
           You can specify a particular  object-code  format  for
          your  object  files as _b_f_d_n_a_m_e.  This may not be neces-
          sary; _o_b_j_d_u_m_p can automatically recognize many formats.
          For example,

          objdump -b oasys -m vax -h fu.o


          Displays summary information from the  section  headers
          (`-h') of `fu.o', which is explicitly identified (`-m')
          as a Vax object file in the format  produced  by  Oasys
          compilers.  You can list the formats available with the
          `-i' option.


     -d   Disassemble.  Display the assembler mnemonics  for  the

          machine instructions from _o_b_j_f_i_l_e_s.


     -f   File header.   Display  summary  information  from  the
          overall header of each file in _o_b_j_f_i_l_e_s.


     -h

     +header
          Header.  Display summary information from  the  section
          headers of the object file.


     -i   Display a list showing  all  architectures  and  object
          formats available for specification with -b or -m.


     -j _n_a_m_e
           Display information only for section _n_a_m_e


     -l   Label the display (using  debugging  information)  with
          the  source  filename and line numbers corresponding to
          the object code shown.


     -m _m_a_c_h_i_n_e
           Specify the object files _o_b_j_f_i_l_e_s are for architecture
          _m_a_c_h_i_n_e.   You  can  list available architectures using
          the `-i' option.


     -r

     +reloc
          Relocation.  Print the relocation entries of the file.


     -s   Display the full contents of any sections requested.


     -t

     +syms
          Symbol Table.  Print the symbol table  entries  of  the
          file.   This  is similar to the information provided by
          the `nm' program.


     -x   Display all available header information, including the
          symbol  table  and  relocation  entries.  Using `-x' is

          equivalent to specifying all of `-a -f -h -r -t'.
