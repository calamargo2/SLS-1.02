       manpath  tries  to determine the user's manpath from a set
       of system defaults and  the  user's  PPAATTHH  ,,  echoing  the
       result  to  the  standard output.  Warnings and errors are
       written to the standard error.   If  a  directory  in  the
       user's path is not listed in the manpath.config file, man-
       path looks for the subdirectories man  or  MAN.   If  they
       exist, they are added to the search path.

       manpath  is  used  by mmaann to determine the search path, so
       user's normally don't need to set the MMAANNPPAATTHH  environment
       variable directly.

       MMAANNPPAATTHH  If  MMAANNPPAATTHH  is  set, mmaannppaatthh echoes its value on
                the standard output and issues a warning  on  the
                standard error.
