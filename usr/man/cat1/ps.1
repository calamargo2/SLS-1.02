       PPss shows information about running processes.  tty name or
       pid must be given after the last option, no space  between
       options and pid or tty, -- is optional.

       Description of the displayed fields:

       PRI    priority,  this is not the priority in task_struct,
              a low number means that the process gets  more  cpu
              time if it can run.

       NI     nice value, a positive value means less cpu time.

       SIZE   virtual image size, size of text+data+stack

       RSS    resident  set size, kilobytes of program in memory.

       WCHAN  name of the kernel function where  the  process  is
              sleeping.

       STAT   status

              R      runnable

              S      sleeping

              D      uninterruptible sleep

              T      stopped or traced

              Z      zombie

              W      process has no resident pages

       %CPU   percentage of cpu time / real time, this is differ-
              ent from UNIX ps

       %MEM   percentage of available memory in use by this  pro-
              cess,  the  total  of all processes can exceed 100%
              because of shared pages. This  is  not  a  decaying
              average as in UNIX ps.

       TT     controlling tty

       TPGID  current process group of controlling tty

       PAGEIN number of major page faults

       TRS    text   resident   size,  does  not  include  shared
              libraries

       DRS    data resident size, includes  dirty  library  pages
              and stack.

       SWAP   kilobytes (with --pp pages) on swap device

       SHRD   shared memory

       DT     dirty library pages (kb or # pages with -p)

       F      process flags

              04     process has used math emulator

              10     process is being traced

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --aa     show processes of all users

       --cc     show command name stored in task_struct

       --ee     show environment, cannot be combined with --ee option

       --hh     no header

       --jj     jobs format: pgid sid

       --ll     long format: flags, wchan, nice value, priority

       --mm     displays memory info (combine with --pp flag  to  get
              number  of  pages): shared and swapped sizes, minor
              and major page faults.  The size field  shown  with
              this  option  is  the  size  computed from the page
              tables, it should be equal to the sum of  SWAP  and
              RSS.

       --XX     another format: displays the registers eip and esp,
              timeout and alarm

       --nn     numeric output for USER and WCHAN

       --rr     running processes only, these include processes  in
              an uninterruptible sleep

       --ss     signal format

       --uu     user format: gives user name and start-time

       --vv     vm format

       --ww     wide output, can be specified more then once

       --xx     show processes without controlling terminal

       --SS     add cpu time and page fault count from reaped chil-
              dren

       --UU     update psdatabase. The arguments syspath and  swap-
              path  if given are stored in the psdatabase and the
              symbol info is updated, if no system path is  given
              the path in the old psdatabase is used.

       --tt_x_x   only  procs with controlling tty _x_x, use for _x_x the
              same letters as shown in TT field. If _x_x is omitted
              the controlling terminal of ps is used.

FFIILLEESS
       /dev/kmem kernel memory
       /dev/swap swapdevice or (link to) swap file
       /etc/psdatabase symbol information

BBUUGGSS
       Tty names are hard coded: virtual consoles are a1, a2, ...
       serial lines are s0 and s1, pty's are p0, p1 ...

       %CPU and %MEM don't give decaying averages, %CPU  is  dif-
       ferent from UNIX ps.

       Things  can  change  while  ppss  is running, the picture it
       gives is only a close approximation to reality.
