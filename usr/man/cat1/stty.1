       This  manual  page  documents the GNU version of ssttttyy.  If
       given no arguments, ssttttyy prints the baud rate, line disci-
       pline  number  (on systems that support it), and line set-
       tings that have been changed from the values set by  `stty
       sane'.   Mode reading and setting are performed on the tty
       line connected to the standard input.

       ssttttyy  accepts  the  following  non-option  arguments  that
       change  aspects  of  the terminal line operation.  A `[-]'
       before a capability means that it can  be  turned  off  by
       preceding it with a `-'.  Some arguments are not available
       on all systems, since they are non-POSIX extensions.

       Control settings:


       [-]parenb

              in input.

       Special characters:


       The special characters' default values vary from system to
       system.  They are set with the syntax `name value',  where
       the  names  are  listed  below  and the value can be given
       either literally, in hat notation (`^c'), or as an integer
       which  may start with `0x' to indicate hexadecimal, `0' to
       indicate octal, or any other digit  to  indicate  decimal.
       Giving  a  value  of `^-' or `undef' disables that special

       Special settings:


       min N  Set the minimum number of characters that will sat-
              isfy  a read until the time value has expired, when

              time  out  if the min number of characters have not
              been read, when -icanon is set.

       The long-named options can be introduced with `+' as  well
       as  `--', for compatibility with previous releases.  Even-

       incompatible with the POSIX.2 standard.
