       eennccooddee  is used to encode a binary file to a text file for
       transmission via electronic mail or network file transfer.
       Three  different  popular encoding schemes are implemented
       in _e_n_c_o_d_e_:  _u_u_e_n_c_o_d_e_,  _x_x_e_n_c_o_d_e_,  and  _b_t_o_a  (subsequently
       called  UU, XX, and BA schemes).  In the case of a missing
       output name the output goes to  standard  output.  If  the
       input  name is missing as well, standard input is used. On
       VM/CMS an input name  is  required.   If  an  output  file
       already exists the default action is to ask whether it may
       be replaced or not or a different name should be used.  On
       VAX/VMS 'replacing' means creating a new file version.  On
       most systems the file names may be in the system  specific
       form  or  in  a  UNIX-like form. On VM/CMS file name, file
       type, and file mode may be separated by blanks  and  those
       parts  which  are  the  same  for  input and output may be
       entered as '=' for the output.
       The encoded file includes the permission for the file  and
       the  original  file name (or an alias name) for recreation
       on the remote system.   Note  that  on  operating  systems
       where uppercase and lowercase letters in filenames are not
       distinguished the original file name is converted to  low-
       ercase but an alias name is not.
       In  order  to  recover  from bad character translations at
       network gateways (e.g. from ASCII to EBCDIC), a  table  of
       the  characters used (64 for the UU and XX schemes, 85 for
       the BA scheme) precedes the encoded file. In addition  the
       number  of  bytes encoded and a cyclic redundancy checksum

       (CRC) are written after the encoded data.   On  IBM  main-
       frames  or compatibles with EBCDIC character set the input
       file is translated by default to  ASCII  before  encoding.
       This  may  be  switched  off with option '-e' or 'EBCdic'.
       Depending on the installation procedure  either  only  one
       translation table or three different tables are available.
       The translation may be reversed without loosing any infor-
       mation  but does not necessarily translate non-ASCII char-
       acters like special French, German, and Spanish characters
       to  the expected representation on a remote machine with a
       different character set.  It is also possible  to  install
       _e_n_c_o_d_e  on  computers with ASCII character set such that a
       translation from ASCII to EBCDIC is available.
       The table method used for the UU and XX schemes is compat-
       ible with that of extended _u_u_e_n_c_o_d_e programs. The original
       BA scheme supplies neither a  table,  nor  permission  and
       file  name.  _e_n_c_o_d_e uses non-standard extensions to the BA
       scheme. These extensions are ignored by the original  _a_t_o_b
       decoding  program.   For  the  UU  encoding scheme a grave
       accent (ASCII character 96) is written instead of a  blank
       (ASCII  character 32) to avoid truncation of lines in net-
       work gateways. Alternatively a sequence character  may  be
       appended  at  the  end of each line by the option '-s' (or
       'SEQuence' on  VM/CMS).   Both  of  these  extensions  are
       acceptable  for decoding by the original _u_u_d_e_c_o_d_e program.
       The number of bytes encoded and  a  checksum  are  written
       after  the  'end'  line  (UU  and XX schemes). Immediately
       after the 'end' line is a line The next  line  'crc  ####'
       contains  a  4-digit  hexadecimal,  the  cyclic redundancy
       checksum '####'.  The 16-bit CRC calculation is done  with
       Mark   G.  Mendel's  _u_p_d_c_r_c_(_)  with  parameters  P=0xA001,
       INIT_CRC=0, SWAPPED=1.  Byte count and CRC are ignored  by
       the original _u_u_d_e_c_o_d_e and _x_x_d_e_c_o_d_e programs but checked by
       _d_e_c_o_d_e_.   Depending  on  the  file   structure   and   the
       binary/text open mode the byte count may be different from
       the number obtained with the system command 'ls' or 'DIR'.
       The  interpretation  of line ends in the input file may be
       controlled with  the  options  '-b'  ('BINary')  and  '-t'
       ('TEXT').  The effect of these options is machine-specific
       and may be even compiler-specific  (see  your  C  compiler
       manual  for fopen() with modes "r" and "rb").  On UNIX and
       for stream format files on VAX/VMS there is no difference.
       On  VAX/VMS  and  on VM/CMS with fixed length and variable
       length records the end of records  is  ignored  in  binary
       mode.   On  MS-DOS  and  ATARI  ST TOS all CR/LF character
       pairs are concatenated to LF and Ctrl-Z characters ignored
       at  the  end-of-file  in  text  mode.  Binary input is the
       default on MS-DOS and ATARI TOS, text input on  all  other
       systems.
       If the encoded output file would be to large to be send as
       a single file it may be split into several parts. In  this
       case  an  output file name has to be specified explicitly,
       i.e. no redirected standard output can be used. By default
       a   number  is  appended  to  that  output  file  name  to

       distinguish the parts. That  number  may  be  inserted  at
       another  place  in the file name if a star '*' is supplied
       at that place. E.g. if the output  file  is  specified  as
       'out*.uue' the parts would be named 'out1.uue', 'out2.uue'
       etc. Each part may contain up to a given number  of  lines
       of encoded data plus header and trailer.

       ddeeccooddee  reads  a file encoded with _e_n_c_o_d_e_, _u_u_e_n_c_o_d_e_, _x_x_e_n_-
       _c_o_d_e_, or _b_t_o_a and recreates the original  binary  file(s).
       Default  input is standard input, default output is a file
       with the name given at the begining of the  encoded  file.
       On  VM/CMS  an input name is required. An output file name
       may be supplied to override the internal name. If a direc-
       tory  path  (without  file name) is supplied, the internal
       name is appended (not applicable on VM/CMS).   On  VAX/VMS
       input  and output file names may be logical names (see the
       DCL commands _D_E_F_I_N_E and _A_S_S_I_G_N ).
       Leading and trailing lines added by mailers  are  ignored.
       The  encoding  scheme will be recognized automatically for
       all files encoded with _e_n_c_o_d_e_, _b_t_o_a or an  extended  _u_u_e_n_-
       _c_o_d_e with character table.  The option '-x' (or 'XXdecode'
       on VM/CMS) is needed to decode files encoded  by  _x_x_e_n_c_o_d_e
       without  character table. Lines truncated by network gate-
       ways are extended by blanks to the required length  and  a
       warning is issued.  If a character table is present and it
       does not match one of the standard  tables  a  warning  is
       issued  and the supplied table is used.  An input file may
       contain several encoded files which can  all  be  restored
       with  a  single call if the encoding scheme of all of them
       can be detected automatically (or is  the  same)  and  all
       output  files  should be created with the same format (see
       below).  As an alternative  only  a  single  file  may  be
       selected for output by the '-o' option.  Large files might
       be encoded to several parts by _e_n_c_o_d_e_.  _d_e_c_o_d_e  reads  all
       parts automatically in the correct order if the first part
       is used as input file (either  explicitly  or  redirected)
       and  all other parts are available with the names given at
       the end of the previous part, respectively. Note that long
       file  names  or machine-dependent directory specifications
       in such part names could disable the automatic decoding of
       split files.
       The interpretation of newline characters may be controlled
       by the options '-b' (or 'BINary' on VM/CMS) and  '-t'  (or
       'TEXT').   On  MS-DOS and ATARI ST TOS '-t' converts CR/LF
       pairs to LF before encoding and converts LF to CR/LF pairs
       after  decoding.  On UNIX, VAX/VMS, and VM/CMS _d_e_c_o_d_e con-
       verts all CR/LF pairs and all single CR characters  to  LF
       and  discards  Ctrl-Z after decoding in the text mode.  On
       UNIX systems and for stream format output files on VAX/VMS
       the  '-b' option usually has no effect, neither for _e_n_c_o_d_e
       nor for _d_e_c_o_d_e_.  On VAX/VMS and  VM/CMS  there  are  addi-
       tional  options  available to control the record format of
       the output file.
       VAX/VMS: The default record format on VAX/VMS is 'variable

       length'  with  record  attribute 'carriage return carriage
       control' where LF characters start new lines and  CR  have
       no  special  meaning. To avoid CR characters in the output
       use the '-t' option.  To  create  variable  record  length
       files without record attribute use the '-b' option.  Fixed
       length record files without record attribute may  be  cre-
       ated  with  the '-f' option. Digits directly following the
       '-f' are interpreted as a record length, if present.   The
       default is 512 bytes. Output files of type 'EXE' and 'TAR'
       will be created by default as if option '-f512'  would  be
       present.  Files  with 'stream_LF' organization (similar to
       UNIX, MS-DOS, or ATARI files) may be created with the '-s'
       option.  However,  such  files can usually only be read by
       other C programs. Most VMS system commands fail to  handle
       stream_LF files.
       VM/CMS  (and to some extend also other IBM mainframe oper-
       ating systems): The default  record  format  is  'variable
       length,  maximum  255  bytes' (text mode output). With the
       '-b' or 'BINARY' option the record format  becomes  'fixed
       length,  80  bytes'  (binary  mode  output).  With '-f' or
       'FIXed' and '-v' or 'VARiable' plus an optional  numerical
       value  (record  length)  fixed  length and variable length
       formats can be achieved instead of  the  default  formats.
       Note  that  for the UNIX-style options the optional record
       length must be entered without a blank while for the  CMS-
       style  options  a  blank  is required (e.g. '-f132' versus
       '(FIX 132'). The default record length for fixed format is
       80  bytes,  the default maximum record length for variable
       format is 255 bytes. The '-e' or 'EBCdic' option  inhibits
       the  translation  of  the output from ASCII to IBM EBCDIC,
       i.e. should only be used if the input is  encoded  EBCDIC.
       Of  course,  the  input  file  itself  should always be in
       EBCDIC on EBCDIC machines and in ASCII on ASCII  machines.

       The UNIX-style options may appear at any place on the com-
       mand line and may be concatenated (e.g. '-b' and  '-x'  to
       '-bx').   Capital  and  lower case letters are equivalent.
       In case of exclusive options the last one is used.

              Digits  directly  following '-f' specify the record

              VAX/VMS,  80  bytes on VM/CMS).  After these digits
              other options may follow.

              of  _e_n_c_o_d_e  command).  Only  the  specified file is
              extracted from an input file containing one or sev-
              eral encoded files.

       --rr     Replace  existing  files  without  any prompts (see
              also '-n').

       --ss     Stream_LF record format is used  for  output  files
              (VAX/VMS only). '-f' and '-s' are exclusive.

       --tt     Decoded file is opened in text mode (not applicable
              to redirected or pipe output). '-b'  and  '-t'  are
              exclusive.

       --vv     Variable  length  record  format is used for output
              files (VAX/VMS and IBM operating systems only).  On
              VAX/VMS  this  is  needed  only to write files with
              file types 'EXE', 'ARC', 'ZIP', 'TAR', and  'TAR-Z'
              with  variable length record format.  For all other
              file types this is the default.  On VM/CMS the max-
              imum  record size is taken from any digits directly
              following the 'v' (default: 255 bytes).

       --xx     Use XX scheme if no table is present in  the  input
              file. '-x' is implicitly assumed on most systems if
              the program is called as _x_x_d_e_c_o_d_e_.

       --zz     The last fixed length record of the output file has
              to  be  filled  (padded)  with  some  character. By
              default it  is  character  0.  Any  integer  number
              between 0 and 255 immediately following the 'z' may
              be used to set a different fill character  (VAX/VMS
              only).

encode, decode(1)                               encode, decode(1)


IInnssttaallllaattiioonn
       The source code of _e_n_c_o_d_e and _d_e_c_o_d_e consists  of  a  five
       files:   encode.c,  decode.c,  encode1.h,  encode2.h,  and
       crc.c. No make file is supplied. Just compile encode.c and
       decode.c  separately.  The other files are included by the
       preprocessor.  On MS-DOS with Microsoft C or Borland Turbo
       C, on ATARI ST with Turbo C, on VAX/VMS with VAX C, and on
       Ultrix with MIPS C no additional definitions are necessary
       for compilation.
       On  VM/CMS  the  identifier  'VMCMS' should be defined, on
       other   IBM    mainframe    operating    systems    define
       'IBM_MAINFRAME' (not tested yet).
       On VAX/VMS _e_n_c_o_d_e and _d_e_c_o_d_e should be defined as DCL sym-
       bols like

       encode:==$disk:[user.path]encode.exe

       The size of the '.EXE' files  may  be  kept  small  if  an
       option file is supplied to the linker containing the line:

       sys$library:vaxcrtl/share

       However, such executables will run only  on  systems  with
       the VAX C Run Time Library installed.
       On  ATARI  ST  computers  _e_n_c_o_d_e and _d_e_c_o_d_e may be created
       with the 'DEFAULT.PRJ' supplied with Turbo C but  executa-
       bles  should  be  renamed  to file types '.TOS' or '.TTP'.
       They may be started from a shell or by double-clicking  on
       the TOS directory entries.  On ATARIs the programs ask for
       the 'command line' when started without arguments (e.g. by
       double-clicking on 'ENCODE.TTP').
       To  enable ASCII to EBCDIC translation for _e_n_c_o_d_e you have
       to define the identifier 'TRANSLATE' at compile-time  with
       option '-DTRANSLATE=1' (on UNIX and with Microsoft C), (on
       VM/CMS), or in the 'Options' menu (Turbo C), or by insert-
       ing  the  line  '#define  TRANSLATE 1' at the beginning of
       encode.c. Note that this option is not  necessary  if  the
       receiver  has  _d_e_c_o_d_e  to  decode  the file because _d_e_c_o_d_e
       translates from ASCII to EBCDIC by default.  To enable all
       three  translation  tables at run-time, define the identi-
       fier 'ALL_TABLES' at compile-time. If you  prefer  another
       translation  table  than  number  3 as the only or default
       table then define either the  identifier  'ISO_2022_TABLE'
       or 'IBM_TABLE' at compile-time.

encode, decode(1)                               encode, decode(1)


       query  issued by _d_e_c_o_d_e and _e_n_d_o_d_e if the existing file is
       on a read-only minidisk and the new file would be  created
       on  another  minidisk.  When using CMS-style names without
       explicit file mode of the input file the file name of  the
       output  file must not consist of a single letter or a let-
       ter plus a digit.
       Due to limitations of the file access  method  used  by  C
       programs  under  VM/CMS the record length is restricted to
       32768 bytes or less. Therefore, no MODULE  files  (excuta-
       bles)  with  65535 bytes records can be encoded or decoded
       unless an additional  conversion  to/from  another  record
       size is applied.
       Input  redirected  from  /  output redirected to character
       oriented devices (e.g. serial  ports)  cannot  be  distin-
       guished  from  keyboard/terminal  (console)  I/O.  On some
       systems  not  even  redirection  from/to  disk  files   is
       detected.   Use  named  I/O  files  or devices rather than
       redirection or pipes in such cases. Otherwise  two  things
       might happen:
       a) Input  to  _e_n_c_o_d_e  and  _d_e_c_o_d_e is standard input and no
       redirection of it is detected: Because  console  input  is
       not  accepted as source for files to be encoded or decoded
       only the syntax will be shown and nothing else done.
       b) Output from _d_e_c_o_d_e is standard output and  no  redirec-
       tion  of  it  is detected: In this case output goes to the
       the file or device  specified  at  the  beginning  of  the
       encoded file.
       With  tha BA scheme neither splitting of files on encoding
       nor automatic decoding of split files are available.
       Split files and multiple files cannot be restored automat-
       ically  by  the  original  _u_u_d_e_c_o_d_e and _x_x_d_e_c_o_d_e programs.
       These programs also don't check the byte count and  cyclic
       redundancy checksum (CRC) written by _e_n_c_o_d_e_.
       When decoding files with UU or XX scheme that were encoded
       by programs other than _e_n_c_o_d_e a warning is issued, inform-
       ing you that neither a byte count nor a CRC are present in
       the input file.
