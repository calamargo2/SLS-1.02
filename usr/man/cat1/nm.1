DESCRIPTION
     GNU nm will list the symbols from object files _o_b_j_f_i_l_e_s.


OPTIONS
     The long and short forms of options, shown here as  alterna-
     tives, are equivalent.


     _o_b_j_f_i_l_e_s...
          Object files whose symbols are to be listed.  If no ob-
          ject files are listed as arguments, nm assumes `a.out'.


     -a

     +debug-syms
          Display debugger-only symbols; normally these  are  not
          listed.


     -g

     +extern-only
          Display only external symbols.


     -p

     +no-sort
          Don't bother to sort the symbols  in  any  order;  just
          print them in the order encountered.


     -n

     +numeric-sort
          Sort symbols numerically by their addresses, not alpha-
          betically by their names.


     -s

     +print-armap
          When listing symbols from archive members, include  the
          index:  a  mapping (stored in the archive by ar or ran-
          lib) of  what  modules  contain  definitions  for  what
          names.


     -o

     +print-file-name
          Precede each symbol by the name of the input file where
          it  was  found,  rather than identifying the input file
          once only before all of its symbols.


     -r

     +reverse-sort
          Reverse the sense of the sort (whether numeric  or  al-
          phabetic); let the last come first.


     +target _b_f_d_n_a_m_e
           Specify an object code format other than your system's
          default  format.   See  objdump(1),  for information on
          listing available formats.


     -u

     +undefined-only
          Display only undefined symbols (those external to  each
          object file).
