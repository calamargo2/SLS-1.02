NAME
     strip-Discard symbols from object files.


SYNOPSIS
     strip
          [-s|+strip-all] [-g|-S|+strip-debug] [-x|+discard-all]
          [-X|+discard-locals] [-T _b_f_d_n_a_m_e] _o_b_j_f_i_l_e_s...

DESCRIPTION
     GNU  strip  will  discard  all  symbols  from  object  files
     _o_b_j_f_i_l_e_s,  if no options are specified; or only certain sym-
     bols, depending on its command-line options.

     strip will not execute unless at least one  object  file  is
     listed.

     _W_A_R_N_I_N_G: strip modifies the files  named  in  its  argument,
     rather than writing modified copies under different names.


OPTIONS
     The long and short forms of options, shown here as  alterna-
     tives, are equivalent.


     -s

     +strip-all
          This is the default case: strip all symbol entries from
          _o_b_j_f_i_l_e_s.


     -g

     -S

     +strip-debug
          Discard  only   debugging   symbol   information   from
          _o_b_j_f_i_l_e_s.


     -x

     +discard-all
          Discard all symbols local to  each  file  in  _o_b_j_f_i_l_e_s.
          _W_A_R_N_I_N_G:  Note  that  +discard-all  discards only _l_o_c_a_l
          symbols, in spite of its name.


     -X

     +discard-locals
          Discard local symbols starting with `L' from each  file
          in  _o_b_j_f_i_l_e_s.   (Some compilers produce internally-used
          symbols that begin with `L'.)


     -T _b_f_d_n_a_m_e
            You  can  specify  a  particular  object-code  format
          _b_f_d_n_a_m_e for _o_b_j_f_i_l_e_s.  This may not be necessary; _s_t_r_i_p
          can automatically recognize many formats.   for  infor-
          mation on listing available formats.
