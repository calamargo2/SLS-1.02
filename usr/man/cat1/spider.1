       _s_p_i_d_e_r  is  a  particularly  challenging double-deck soli-
       taire.  Unlike most solitaires, it provides  extraordinary
       opportunities for the skillful player to overcome bad luck
       in the deal by  means  of  careful  analysis  and  complex
       manipulations.   The _s_p_i_d_e_r program does not actually play
       the game for you, but rather takes the place of the  cards
       (by  displaying  the  tableau on the screen) and keeping a
       record of the game so that you can follow out  long  lines
       of play without losing track of where you started from.

       _s_p_i_d_e_r  when  compiled with XView has a property sheet for
       defining resources.  The property sheet is on  the  "File"
       menu  item.  To be sure spot help is active, set the envi-
       ronment variable HELPDIR to the directory  containing  the
       spider.info file.

       _s_p_i_d_e_r  understands  all  of  the  core X Toolkit resource
       names and classes as well as:

       bbeellll ((class BBeellll))
               Boolean which specifies whether  _s_p_i_d_e_r  will  use
               the  bell to when complaining about illegal moves.
               The default is "true".

       ccoonnffiirrmm ((class CCoonnffiirrmm))
               Boolean which specifies whether  _s_p_i_d_e_r  will  use
               ask  for confirmation before certain actions.  The
               default is "true".

       rreeppllaayyTTiimmee ((class RReeppllaayyTTiimmee))
               Specifies the  time  (in  microseconds)  to  pause
               between  each  move  when  showing  a Replay.  The
               default is 200.

       rroouunnddssCCaarrddss ((class RRoouunnddCCaarrddss))
               Specifies whether to use rounded  cards  are  not.
               Rounded  cards  look  better, but are considerably
               slower.  The default is "on".

       ddeellttaaMMoodd ((class DDeellttaaMMoodd))
               Specifies the interval at which to recalulate  the

               inter-card spacing.  The default is 1, which means
               the card stacks are resized every time  they  grow
               or  shrink  when  when they near the bottom of the
               table.  Setting this to a higher  value  will  cut
               down on the number of redraws by limiting visibil-
               ity when its unnecessary.

       hheellppDDiirr ((class HHeellppDDiirr))
               Specifies where to look for the help files.
