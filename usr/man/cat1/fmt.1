       _f_m_t  is  a  simple  text formatter.  It inserts or deletes
       newlines, as necessary, to make all lines in  a  paragraph
       be approximately the same width.  It preserves indentation
       and word spacing.

       The default line width is 72 characters.  You can override
       this with the -_w_i_d_t_h flag.  If you don't name any files on
       the command line, then _f_m_t will read from stdin.

       It is typically used from within _v_i  to  adjust  the  line
       breaks in a single paragraph.  To do this, move the cursor
       to the  top  of  the  paragraph,  type  "!}fmt",  and  hit
       <Return>.
