       _L_e_s_s_k_e_y  is  used  to  specify a set of key bindings to be
       used by _l_e_s_s_.   The  input  file  is  a  text  file  which
       describes  the  key  bindings,  and  the  output file is a
       binary file which is used by _l_e_s_s_.  If no  input  file  is
       specified,  standard  input is used.  If no output file is
       specified, $HOME/.less is used.

       The input file consists of lines of the form:

            string <whitespace> action [extra-string] <newline>

       Whitespace is any sequence of one or  more  spaces  and/or
       tabs.  The "string" is the command key(s) which invoke the
       action.  The string may be a  single  command  key,  or  a
       sequence  of  up  to 15 keys.  The "action" is the name of
       the less action, from the list below.  The  characters  in
       the  "string"  may  appear  literally, or be prefixed by a
       carat to indicate a control key.  A backslash may be  used
       to  cause  the  following character to be taken literally.
       Characters which must be  preceded  by  backslash  include
       carat,  space,  tab and the backslash itself.  A backslash
       followed by one to three octal digits may be used to spec-
       ify a character by its octal value.  Blank lines and lines
       which start with a pound sign (#) are ignored.

       An action may be followed by an extra string.  This string
       is parsed after the command is entered, just as if it were
       entered on the command line.  This feature can be used  in
       certain  cases  to  extend the functionality of a command.
       For example, these entries would create a pair of commands
       to turn on/off line numbers using _v_i syntax:

            :set\ nu       toggle-option -N
            :set\ nonu     toggle-option +N

       See also the ":ta" command in the example below.

       Commands specified by _l_e_s_s_k_e_y  take  precedence  over  the
       default  commands.   A default command key may be disabled
       by including it in the key file with the action "invalid".
