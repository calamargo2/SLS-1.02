NAME
     locate - list files in a database that match a pattern

SYNOPSIS
     locate pattern...

DESCRIPTION
     This manual page documents the GNU version of  locate.   For
     each  given pattern, which can contain shell-style metachar-
     acters, locate searches a database  of  file  pathnames  and
     displays the pathnames that contain the pattern.

     The database contains a list of the files that were  on  the
     system  whenever  the  database  was last updated.  The fre-
     quency with which the database is  updated  and  the  direc-
     tories for which it contains entries are configurable by the
     system administrator.
