NAME
     size-list section sizes and total size.


SYNOPSIS
     size [-A|-B|+format _c_o_m_p_a_t_i_b_i_l_i_t_y] [+help]
          [-d|-o|-x|+radix _n_u_m_b_e_r] [+target _b_f_d_n_a_m_e]
          [-V|+version] _o_b_j_f_i_l_e_s...

DESCRIPTION
     The GNU size utility lists the section sizes-and  the  total
     size-for  each  of the object files _o_b_j_f_i_l_e_s in its argument
     list.  By default, one line of output is generated for  each
     object file or each module in an archive.


OPTIONS
     _o_b_j_f_i_l_e_s...
          The object files to be examined.


     -A

     -B

     +format _c_o_m_p_a_t_i_b_i_l_i_t_y
           Using one of these options, you can choose whether the
          output  from  GNU  size  resembles output from System V
          size (using `-A', or `+format sysv'), or Berkeley  size
          (using  `-B',  or  `+format berkeley').  The default is
          the one-line format similar to Berkeley's.


     +help
          Show a summary of acceptable arguments and options.


     -d

     -o

     -x

     +radix _n_u_m_b_e_r
           Using one of these options, you  can  control  whether
          the  size of each section is given in decimal (`-d', or
          `+radix 10'); octal (`-o', or `+radix 8');  or  hexade-
          cimal (`-x', or `+radix 16').  In `+radix _n_u_m_b_e_r', only
          the three values (8, 10, 16) are supported.  The  total
          size  is always given in two radices; decimal and hexa-
          decimal for `-d' or `-x' output, or octal  and  hexade-
          cimal if you're using `-o'.

     +target _b_f_d_n_a_m_e
           You can specify a particular  object-code  format  for
          _o_b_j_f_i_l_e_s  as  _b_f_d_n_a_m_e.  This may not be necessary; _s_i_z_e
          can  automatically  recognize   many   formats.     See
          objdump(1)  for  information  on listing available for-
          mats.


     -V

     +version
          Display version number information on size itself.
